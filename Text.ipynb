Here is a young lady,\\r\\nrichly dressedâ\\x80\\x94fashionable hat, magnificent furs. She is coming\\r\\nalong slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. Unknown to her,\\r\\nshe is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. They\\r\\nhave just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl,\\r\\ngesticulating as he does so. What drama is this being played? Is\\r\\nthe girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to\\r\\narrest her? Or are _they_ the scoundrels, and are they plotting to\\r\\nattack an innocent victim? What does the great detective say?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe great detective, _mon ami_, chooses, as ever, the simplest\\r\\ncourse. He rises to see for himself.â\\x80\\x9d And my friend joined me at\\r\\nthe window.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism.\\r\\nThat is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by\\r\\na bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, _en passant_, my\\r\\ndear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It\\r\\nwas a mere matter of recognition.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_En vÃ©ritÃ©!_ And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the\\r\\nscreen, _mon cher_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout a dozen times perhaps.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Iâ\\x80\\x94once! Yet _I_ recognize her, and _you_ do not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe looks so different,â\\x80\\x9d I replied rather feebly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! _SacrÃ©_!â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cIs it that you expect her to promenade\\r\\nherself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare\\r\\nfeet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you\\r\\nit is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie\\r\\nSaintclair.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut console yourself, _mon ami_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, calming down. â\\x80\\x9cAll\\r\\ncannot be as Hercule Poirot! I know it well.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone I ever\\r\\nknew!â\\x80\\x9d I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat will you? When one is unique, one knows it! And others share\\r\\nthat opinionâ\\x80\\x94even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWithout doubt. She is coming here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you make that out?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery simply. This street, it is not aristocratic, _mon ami_! In\\r\\nit there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentistâ\\x80\\x94still\\r\\nless is there a fashionable milliner! But there _is_ a fashionable\\r\\ndetective. _Oui_, my friend, it is trueâ\\x80\\x94I am become the mode, the\\r\\n_dernier cri_! One says to another: â\\x80\\x98_Comment?_ You have lost your\\r\\ngold pencil-case? You must go to the little Belgian. He is too\\r\\nmarvellous! Every one goes! _Courez!â\\x80\\x99_ And they arrive! In flocks,\\r\\n_mon ami_! With problems of the most foolish!â\\x80\\x9d A bell rang below.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs usual, Poirot was right. After a short interval, the American\\r\\nfilm star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary Marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on\\r\\nthe screen. She had only lately arrived in England in company with\\r\\nher husband, Gregory B. Rolf, also a film actor. Their marriage\\r\\nhad taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their\\r\\nfirst visit to England. They had been given a great reception.\\r\\nEvery one was prepared to go mad over Mary Marvell, her wonderful\\r\\nclothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great\\r\\ndiamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, â\\x80\\x9cthe Western\\r\\nStar.â\\x80\\x9d Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous\\r\\nstone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of\\r\\nfifty thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with\\r\\nPoirot in greeting our fair client.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking,\\r\\nwith the wide innocent blue eyes of a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord\\r\\nCronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up\\r\\nthe mystery of his nephewâ\\x80\\x99s death, and I felt that I just must have\\r\\nyour advice. I dare say itâ\\x80\\x99s only a silly hoaxâ\\x80\\x94Gregory says soâ\\x80\\x94but\\r\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s just worrying me to death.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s these letters.â\\x80\\x9d Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew\\r\\nout three envelopes which she handed to Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter scrutinized them closely.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCheap paperâ\\x80\\x94the name and address carefully printed. Let us see\\r\\nthe inside.â\\x80\\x9d He drew out the enclosure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing\\r\\nconsisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.\\r\\nIt ran as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return\\r\\nwhence it came.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the\\r\\nthird was more explicit:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have been warned. You have not obeyed. Now the diamond will\\r\\nbe taken from you. At the full of the moon, the two diamonds which\\r\\nare the left and right eye of the god shall return. So it is\\r\\nwritten.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe first letter I treated as a joke,â\\x80\\x9d explained Miss Marvell.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I got the second, I began to wonder. The third one came\\r\\nyesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might\\r\\nbe more serious than I had imagined.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see they did not come by post, these letters.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; they were left by handâ\\x80\\x94by a _Chinaman._ That is what frightens\\r\\nme.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought\\r\\nthe stone three years ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to beâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The Western Star,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d finished Miss Marvell. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s so. At the\\r\\ntime, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the\\r\\nstone, but the Chink wasnâ\\x80\\x99t handing out any information. Gregory\\r\\nsays he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get\\r\\nrid of the thing. He only asked about a tenth of its value. It was\\r\\nGregâ\\x80\\x99s wedding present to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. And yetâ\\x80\\x94who\\r\\nknows? I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI complied.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Voyons!_â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, turning the leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen is the date of the full moon? Ah, Friday next. That is in\\r\\nthree daysâ\\x80\\x99 time. _Eh bien_, madame, you seek my adviceâ\\x80\\x94I give it\\r\\nto you. This _belle histoire_ may be a hoaxâ\\x80\\x94but it may not!\\r\\nTherefore I counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until\\r\\nafter Friday next. Then we can take what steps we please.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA slight cloud passed over the actressâ\\x80\\x99s face, and she replied\\r\\nconstrainedly:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid thatâ\\x80\\x99s impossible.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have it with youâ\\x80\\x94_hein_?â\\x80\\x9d Poirot was watching her narrowly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom\\r\\nof her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. She leaned forward,\\r\\nunclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely\\r\\nset in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot drew in his breath with a long hiss.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Ã\\x89patant!_â\\x80\\x9d he murmured. â\\x80\\x9cYou permit, madame?â\\x80\\x9d He took the jewel\\r\\nin his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her\\r\\nwith a little bow. â\\x80\\x9cA magnificent stoneâ\\x80\\x94without a flaw. Ah, _cent\\r\\ntonnerres!_ and you carry it about with you, _comme Ã§a_!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, Iâ\\x80\\x99m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot. As a rule itâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlocked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit.\\r\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99re staying at the _Magnificent_, you know. I just brought it\\r\\nalong to-day for you to see.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you will leave it with me, _nâ\\x80\\x99est-ce pas_? You will be advised\\r\\nby Papa Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you see, itâ\\x80\\x99s this way, Monsieur Poirot. On Friday weâ\\x80\\x99re\\r\\ngoing down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady\\r\\nYardly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. Some\\r\\ngossipâ\\x80\\x94what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had\\r\\npaid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had\\r\\nrather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady\\r\\nfriendsâ\\x80\\x94but surely there was something more, some gossip which\\r\\ncoupled Lady Yardlyâ\\x80\\x99s name with that of a â\\x80\\x9cmovieâ\\x80\\x9d star in\\r\\nCaliforniaâ\\x80\\x94why! it came to me in a flashâ\\x80\\x94of course it was none\\r\\nother than Gregory B. Rolf.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d Miss Marvell\\r\\nwas continuing. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s some\\r\\nchance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral\\r\\npile.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt Yardly Chase?â\\x80\\x9d I cried, interested. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, itâ\\x80\\x99s one of the show\\r\\nplaces of England.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Marvell nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI guess itâ\\x80\\x99s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a\\r\\npretty stiff price, and of course I donâ\\x80\\x99t know yet whether the deal\\r\\nwill go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business\\r\\nwith pleasure.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80\\x94I demand pardon if I am dense, madameâ\\x80\\x94surely it is possible\\r\\nto visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvellâ\\x80\\x99s eyes which belied\\r\\ntheir childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want to wear it down there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurelyâ\\x80\\x9d I said suddenly, â\\x80\\x9cthere are some very famous jewels in\\r\\nthe Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s so,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Marvell briefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: â\\x80\\x9cAh, _câ\\x80\\x99est comme Ã§a_!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThen he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the\\r\\nbullâ\\x80\\x99s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): â\\x80\\x9cThen you\\r\\nare without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps\\r\\nyour husband is?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss\\r\\nMarvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: â\\x80\\x9cDo\\r\\neither of you ever see _Society Gossip_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI ask because in this weekâ\\x80\\x99s number there is an article on famous\\r\\njewels, and itâ\\x80\\x99s really very curiousâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d She broke off.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned\\r\\nwith the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found\\r\\nthe article, and began to read aloud:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the\\r\\nEast, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor\\r\\nof the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China,\\r\\nand a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this,\\r\\nthe stone was once the right eye of a temple god. Another diamond,\\r\\nexactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the\\r\\nstory goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once\\r\\nmore. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.â\\x80\\x99 It is a\\r\\ncurious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone\\r\\ncorresponding closely in description with this one, and known as\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98the Star of the West,â\\x80\\x99 or â\\x80\\x98the Western Star.â\\x80\\x99 It is the property\\r\\nof the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of\\r\\nthe two stones would be interesting.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Ã\\x89patant!_â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cWithout doubt a romance of the first\\r\\nwater.â\\x80\\x9d He turned to Mary Marvell. â\\x80\\x9cAnd you are not afraid, madame?\\r\\nYou have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce\\r\\nthese two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear\\r\\nand, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of\\r\\nseriousness lay beneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe that Lady Yardlyâ\\x80\\x99s diamond is anything like as\\r\\ngood a stone as mine,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Marvell. â\\x80\\x9cAnyway, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to\\r\\nsee.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment\\r\\nthe door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the\\r\\nroom. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his\\r\\npatent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI said Iâ\\x80\\x99d call round for you, Mary,â\\x80\\x9d said Gregory Rolf, â\\x80\\x9cand here\\r\\nI am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem?\\r\\nJust one big hoax, same as I do?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,â\\x80\\x9d he said dryly, â\\x80\\x9cI have advised Madame\\r\\nyour wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m with you there, sir. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve already said so to Mary. But there!\\r\\nSheâ\\x80\\x99s a woman through and through, and I guess she canâ\\x80\\x99t bear to\\r\\nthink of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat nonsense, Gregory!â\\x80\\x9d said Mary Marvell sharply. But she\\r\\nflushed angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMadame, I have advised. I can do no more. _Câ\\x80\\x99est fini_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed them both to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! _la la_,â\\x80\\x9d he observed, returning. â\\x80\\x9c_Histoire de femmes!_ The\\r\\ngood husband, he hit the nail on the headâ\\x80\\x94_tout de mÃªme_, he was\\r\\nnot tactful! Assuredly not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI imparted to him my vague remembrances, and he nodded vigorously.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I thought. All the same, there is something curious underneath\\r\\nall this. With your permission, _mon ami_, I will take the air.\\r\\nAwait my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door,\\r\\nand put her head in.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve told her he was\\r\\nout, but she says as how sheâ\\x80\\x99ll wait, seeing as sheâ\\x80\\x99s come up from\\r\\nthe country.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something\\r\\nfor her.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a\\r\\nleap as I recognized her. Lady Yardlyâ\\x80\\x99s portrait had figured too\\r\\noften in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo sit down, Lady Yardly,â\\x80\\x9d I said, drawing forward a chair. â\\x80\\x9cMy\\r\\nfriend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that heâ\\x80\\x99ll be back very\\r\\nshortly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss\\r\\nMary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud\\r\\nfaceâ\\x80\\x94yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npresence I have frequently felt a difficultyâ\\x80\\x94I do not appear at my\\r\\nbest. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive\\r\\nsense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLady Yardly,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cI know why you have come here. You have\\r\\nreceived blackmailing letters about the diamond.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at\\r\\nme open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know?â\\x80\\x9d she gasped. â\\x80\\x9cHow?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning\\r\\nlettersâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Marvell? She has been here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one\\r\\nof the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings,\\r\\nyou, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done\\r\\nthe same. You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have\\r\\nreceived these strange communications also?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me\\r\\nor not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is so,â\\x80\\x9d she acknowledged.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWere yours, too, left by handâ\\x80\\x94by a Chinaman?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone\\r\\nthe same experience, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI recounted to her the events of the morning. She listened\\r\\nattentively.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers. It is true\\r\\nthat they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating\\r\\nthemâ\\x80\\x94something in the nature of joss-stickâ\\x80\\x94that at once suggested\\r\\nthe East to me. What does it all mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We\\r\\nmight learn something from the postmarks.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUnfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I\\r\\nregarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese\\r\\ngang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too\\r\\nincredible.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went over the facts again and again, but could get no further\\r\\ntowards the elucidation of the mystery. At last Lady Yardly rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really donâ\\x80\\x99t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell\\r\\nhim all this, canâ\\x80\\x99t you? Thank you so much, Mr.â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated, her hand outstretched.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCaptain Hastings.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course! How stupid of me. Youâ\\x80\\x99re a friend of the Cavendishes,\\r\\narenâ\\x80\\x99t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what\\r\\nhad occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather\\r\\nsharply over the details of our conversation and I could read\\r\\nbetween the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent.\\r\\nI also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined\\r\\nto be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently\\r\\nbelittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no\\r\\nloophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself,\\r\\nthough I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In\\r\\nspite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint\\r\\nlittle friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Bien!_â\\x80\\x9d he said at length, with a curious look on his face. â\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nplot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that â\\x80\\x98Peerageâ\\x80\\x99 on the top shelf\\r\\nthere.â\\x80\\x9d He turned the leaves. â\\x80\\x9cAh, here we are! â\\x80\\x98Yardly . . . 10th\\r\\nviscount, served South African Warâ\\x80\\x99 . . . _tout Ã§a nâ\\x80\\x99a pas\\r\\ndâ\\x80\\x99importance_ . . . â\\x80\\x98mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth\\r\\ndaughter of 3rd Baron Cotterilâ\\x80\\x99 . . . um, um, um, . . . â\\x80\\x98has iss.\\r\\ntwo daughters, born 1908, 1910. . . . Clubs . . . residences.â\\x80\\x99 . . .\\r\\n_VoilÃ\\xa0_, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see\\r\\nthis _milord_!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. I telegraphed to him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought you had washed your hands of the case?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided\\r\\nby my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfactionâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nsatisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in\\r\\nthis pie.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you calmly wire Lord Yardly to dash up to town just to suit\\r\\nyour convenience. He wonâ\\x80\\x99t be pleased.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Au contraire_, if I preserve for him his family diamond, he ought\\r\\nto be very grateful.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you really think there is a chance of it being stolen?â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nasked eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlmost a certainty,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot placidly. â\\x80\\x9cEverything points\\r\\nthat way.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut howâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot now, I pray you. Let us not confuse the mind. And observe that\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Peerageâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest\\r\\nbooks go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath,\\r\\nand so on. Thus we have order, _method_, which, as I have often\\r\\ntold you, Hastingsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly,â\\x80\\x9d I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its\\r\\nproper place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with\\r\\na rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that\\r\\nwas distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExtraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Canâ\\x80\\x99t make head or\\r\\ntail of it. Seems my wifeâ\\x80\\x99s been getting odd kind of letters, and\\r\\nthat this Miss Marvellâ\\x80\\x99s had â\\x80\\x99em too. What does it all mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot handed him the copy of _Society Gossip_.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFirst, _milord_, I would ask you if these facts are substantially\\r\\ncorrect?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peer took it. His face darkened with anger as he read.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDamned nonsense!â\\x80\\x9d he spluttered. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s never been any romantic\\r\\nstory attaching to the diamond. It came from India originally, I\\r\\nbelieve. I never heard of all this Chinese god stuff.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill, the stone _is_ known as â\\x80\\x98The Star of the East.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what if it is?â\\x80\\x9d he demanded wrathfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply. â\\x80\\x9cWhat I would\\r\\nask you to do, _milord_, is to place yourself in my hands. If you\\r\\ndo so unreservedly, I have great hopes of averting the catastrophe.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you think thereâ\\x80\\x99s actually something in these wild-cat\\r\\ntales?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you do as I ask you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I will, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Bien!_ Then permit that I ask you a few questions. This affair\\r\\nof Yardly Chase, is it, as you say, all fixed up between you and\\r\\nMr. Rolf?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, he told you about it, did he? No, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing settled.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nHe hesitated, the brick-red colour of his face deepening. â\\x80\\x9cMight\\r\\nas well get the thing straight. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve made rather an ass of myself\\r\\nin many ways, Monsieur Poirotâ\\x80\\x94and Iâ\\x80\\x99m head over ears in debtâ\\x80\\x94but\\r\\nI want to pull up. Iâ\\x80\\x99m fond of the kids, and I want to straighten\\r\\nthings up, and be able to live on at the old place. Gregory Rolf\\r\\nis offering me big moneyâ\\x80\\x94enough to set me on my feet again. I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nwant to do itâ\\x80\\x94I hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting\\r\\nround the Chaseâ\\x80\\x94but I may have to, unlessâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He broke off.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot eyed him keenly. â\\x80\\x9cYou have, then, another string to your\\r\\nbow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the\\r\\nEast?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Yardly nodded. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s been in the family for some\\r\\ngenerations, but itâ\\x80\\x99s not entailed. Still, itâ\\x80\\x99s not the easiest\\r\\nthing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden\\r\\nman, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but heâ\\x80\\x99ll have to\\r\\nfind one soon, or itâ\\x80\\x99s a washout.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne more question, _permettez_â\\x80\\x94Lady Yardly, which plan does she\\r\\napprove?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, sheâ\\x80\\x99s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel. You know what\\r\\nwomen are. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s all for this film stunt.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI comprehend,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot. He remained a moment or so in thought,\\r\\nthen rose briskly to his feet. â\\x80\\x9cYou return to Yardly Chase at once?\\r\\n_Bien!_ Say no word to anyoneâ\\x80\\x94to _anyone_ mindâ\\x80\\x94but expect us there\\r\\nthis evening. We will arrive shortly after five.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t seeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Ã\\x87a nâ\\x80\\x99a pas dâ\\x80\\x99importance_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot kindly. â\\x80\\x9cYou will that I\\r\\npreserve for you your diamond, _nâ\\x80\\x99est-ce pas_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen do as I say.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA sadly bewildered nobleman left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was half-past five when we arrived at Yardly Chase, and followed\\r\\nthe dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of\\r\\nblazing logs. A pretty picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her\\r\\ntwo children, the motherâ\\x80\\x99s proud dark head bent down over the two\\r\\nfair ones. Lord Yardly stood near, smiling down on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,â\\x80\\x9d announced the butler.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward\\r\\nuncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from Poirot. The little\\r\\nman was equal to the occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll my excuses! It is that I investigate still this affair of Miss\\r\\nMarvellâ\\x80\\x99s. She comes to you on Friday, does she not? I make a\\r\\nlittle tour first to make sure that all is secure. Also I wanted\\r\\nto ask of Lady Yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on\\r\\nthe letters she received?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Yardly shook her head regretfully. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid I donâ\\x80\\x99t. It is\\r\\nstupid of me. But, you see, I never dreamt of taking them\\r\\nseriously.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll stay the night?â\\x80\\x9d said Lord Yardly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, _milord_, I fear to incommode you. We have left our bags at\\r\\nthe inn.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s all right.â\\x80\\x9d Lord Yardly had his cue. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll send down for\\r\\nthem. No, noâ\\x80\\x94no trouble, I assure you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by Lady\\r\\nYardly, began to make friends with the children. In a short time\\r\\nthey were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Vous Ãªtes bonne mÃ¨re_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, with a gallant little bow,\\r\\nas the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Yardly smoothed her ruffled hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI adore them,â\\x80\\x9d she said with a little catch in her voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd they youâ\\x80\\x94with reason!â\\x80\\x9d Poirot bowed again.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms. At that\\r\\nmoment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he\\r\\nhanded to Lord Yardly. The latter tore it open with a brief word\\r\\nof apology. As he read it he stiffened visibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. Then he glanced at\\r\\nmy friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust a minute, Monsieur Poirot. I feel you ought to know about\\r\\nthis. Itâ\\x80\\x99s from Hoffberg. He thinks heâ\\x80\\x99s found a customer for the\\r\\ndiamondâ\\x80\\x94an American, sailing for the States to-morrow. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nsending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. By Jove, though, if\\r\\nthis goes throughâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Words failed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Yardly had turned away. She still held the telegram in her\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t sell it, George,â\\x80\\x9d she said, in a low voice.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s been in the family so long.â\\x80\\x9d She waited, as though for a\\r\\nreply, but when none came her face hardened. She shrugged her\\r\\nshoulders. â\\x80\\x9cI must go and dress. I suppose I had better display\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98the goods.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d She turned to Poirot with a slight grimace. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\none of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! George\\r\\nhas always promised to have the stones reset for me, but itâ\\x80\\x99s never\\r\\nbeen done.â\\x80\\x9d She left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room\\r\\nawaiting the lady. It was already a few minutes past the dinner\\r\\nhour.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly there was a low rustle, and Lady Yardly appeared framed\\r\\nin the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress.\\r\\nRound the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. She stood there\\r\\nwith one hand just touching the necklace.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBehold the sacrifice,â\\x80\\x9d she said gaily. Her ill-humour seemed to\\r\\nhave vanished. â\\x80\\x9cWait while I turn the big light on and you shall\\r\\nfeast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe switches were just outside the door. As she stretched out her\\r\\nhand to them, the incredible thing happened. Suddenly without any\\r\\nwarning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from\\r\\nthe other side of it came a long-drawn piercing womanâ\\x80\\x99s scream.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy God!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lord Yardly. â\\x80\\x9cThat was Maudeâ\\x80\\x99s voice! What has\\r\\nhappened?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the\\r\\ndarkness. It was some minutes before we could find it. What a sight\\r\\nmet our eyes! Lady Yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a\\r\\ncrimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been\\r\\nwrenched from her neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we bent over her, uncertain for the moment whether she were dead\\r\\nor alive, her eyelids opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Chinaman,â\\x80\\x9d she whispered painfully. â\\x80\\x9cThe Chinamanâ\\x80\\x94the side\\r\\ndoor.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Yardly sprang up with an oath. I accompanied him, my heart\\r\\nbeating wildly. The Chinaman again! The side door in question was\\r\\na small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards\\r\\nfrom the scene of the tragedy. As we reached it, I gave a cry.\\r\\nThere, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace,\\r\\nevidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. I\\r\\nswooped joyously down on it. Then I uttered another cry which Lord\\r\\nYardly echoed. For in the middle of the necklace was a great gap.\\r\\nThe Star of the East was missing!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat settles it,â\\x80\\x9d I breathed. â\\x80\\x9cThese were no ordinary thieves.\\r\\nThis one stone was all they wanted.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how did the fellow get in?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThrough this door.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s always locked.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not locked now. See.â\\x80\\x9d I pulled it open as\\r\\nI spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I did so something fluttered to the ground. I picked it up. It\\r\\nwas a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. It had\\r\\nbeen torn from a Chinamanâ\\x80\\x99s robe.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn his haste it caught in the door,â\\x80\\x9d I explained. â\\x80\\x9cCome, hurry.\\r\\nHe cannot have gone far as yet.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in vain we hunted and searched. In the pitch darkness of the\\r\\nnight, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. We returned\\r\\nreluctantly, and Lord Yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste\\r\\nto fetch the police.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Yardly, aptly ministered to by Poirot, who is as good as a\\r\\nwoman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to\\r\\ntell her story.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was just going to turn on the other light,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cwhen a\\r\\nman sprang on me from behind. He tore my necklace from my neck with\\r\\nsuch force that I fell headlong to the floor. As I fell I saw him\\r\\ndisappearing through the side door. Then I realized by the pig-tail\\r\\nand the embroidered robe that he was a Chinaman.â\\x80\\x9d She stopped with\\r\\na shudder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe butler reappeared. He spoke in a low voice to Lord Yardly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA gentleman from Mr. Hoffbergâ\\x80\\x99s, mâ\\x80\\x99lord. He says you expect him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d cried the distracted nobleman. â\\x80\\x9cI must see him, I\\r\\nsuppose. No, not here, Mullings, in the library.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI drew Poirot aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, my dear fellow, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t we better get back to London?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think so, Hastings? Why?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94I coughed delicatelyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthings havenâ\\x80\\x99t gone very well, have\\r\\nthey? I mean, you tell Lord Yardly to place himself in your hands\\r\\nand all will be wellâ\\x80\\x94and then the diamond vanishes from under your\\r\\nvery nose!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTrue,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, rather crestfallen. â\\x80\\x9cIt was not one of my most\\r\\nstriking triumphs.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but I\\r\\nstuck to my guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, havingâ\\x80\\x94pardon the expressionâ\\x80\\x94rather made a mess of things,\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the\\r\\n_chef_ of Lord Yardly has prepared?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, whatâ\\x80\\x99s dinner!â\\x80\\x9d I said impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot held up his hands in horror.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ It is that in this country you treat the affairs\\r\\ngastronomic with a criminal indifference.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s another reason why we should get back to London as soon\\r\\nas possible,â\\x80\\x9d I continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is that, my friend?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe other diamond,â\\x80\\x9d I said, lowering my voice. â\\x80\\x9cMiss Marvellâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien_, what of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you see?â\\x80\\x9d His unusual obtuseness annoyed me. What had\\r\\nhappened to his usually keen wits? â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99ve got one, now theyâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ngo for the other.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Tiens!_â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with\\r\\nadmiration. â\\x80\\x9cBut your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Figure\\r\\nto yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But\\r\\nthere is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until\\r\\nFriday.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me\\r\\nentirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed\\r\\nimmediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology\\r\\nfor Lord Yardly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy idea was to go at once to the _Magnificent_, and relate to Miss\\r\\nMarvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted\\r\\nthat the morning would be time enough. I gave in rather grudgingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. I\\r\\nbegan to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was\\r\\nsingularly loath to proceed with the case. In answer to my\\r\\npersuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as\\r\\nthe details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the\\r\\nmorning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell\\r\\nthem. I gave way unwillingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvents proved my forebodings to be justified. About two oâ\\x80\\x99clock,\\r\\nthe telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some\\r\\nmoments, then with a brief â\\x80\\x9c_Bien, jâ\\x80\\x99y serai_â\\x80\\x9d he rang off, and\\r\\nturned to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think, _mon ami_?â\\x80\\x9d He looked half ashamed, half\\r\\nexcited. â\\x80\\x9cThe diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d I cried, springing up. â\\x80\\x9cAnd what about the â\\x80\\x98full of the\\r\\nmoonâ\\x80\\x99 now?â\\x80\\x9d Poirot hung his head. â\\x80\\x9cWhen did this happen?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis morning, I understand.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head sadly. â\\x80\\x9cIf only you had listened to me. You see I\\r\\nwas right.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt appears so, _mon ami_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot cautiously. â\\x80\\x9cAppearances\\r\\nare deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we hurried in a taxi to the _Magnificent_, I puzzled out the\\r\\ntrue inwardness of the scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat â\\x80\\x98full of the moonâ\\x80\\x99 idea was clever. The whole point of it\\r\\nwas to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard\\r\\nbeforehand. It is a pity you did not realize that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Ma foi!_â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored\\r\\nafter its brief eclipse. â\\x80\\x9cOne cannot think of everything!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt sorry for him. He did so hate failure of any kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCheer up,â\\x80\\x9d I said consolingly. â\\x80\\x9cBetter luck next time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the _Magnificent_, we were ushered at once into the managerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\noffice. Gregory Rolf was there with two men from Scotland Yard. A\\r\\npale-faced clerk sat opposite them.\\r\\n\\r\\nRolf nodded to us as we entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re getting to the bottom of it,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s almost\\r\\nunbelievable. How the guy had the nerve I canâ\\x80\\x99t think.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. Mr. Rolf had gone\\r\\nout of the hotel at 11.15. At 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in\\r\\nappearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the\\r\\njewel-case from the safe deposit. He duly signed the receipt,\\r\\nremarking carelessly as he did so: â\\x80\\x9cLooks a bit different from my\\r\\nordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.â\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\nclerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference.\\r\\nRolf laughed and said: â\\x80\\x9cWell, donâ\\x80\\x99t run me in as a crook this time,\\r\\nanyway. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and\\r\\nthe worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myselfâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s something\\r\\nabout the eyes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI looked at him,â\\x80\\x9d said the clerk who was telling us this, â\\x80\\x9cand I\\r\\nsaw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like\\r\\nan Orientalâ\\x80\\x99s. Iâ\\x80\\x99d never noticed it before.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDarn it all, man,â\\x80\\x9d roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, â\\x80\\x9cdo you\\r\\nnotice it now?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man looked up at him and started.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t say I do.â\\x80\\x9d And indeed there was\\r\\nnothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that\\r\\nlooked into ours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scotland Yard man grunted. â\\x80\\x9cBold customer. Thought the eyes\\r\\nmight be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm\\r\\nsuspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and\\r\\nnipped in as soon as you were well away.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat about the jewel-case?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was found in a corridor of the hotel. Only one thing had been\\r\\ntakenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98the Western Star.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stared at each otherâ\\x80\\x94the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot hopped briskly to his feet. â\\x80\\x9cI have not been of much use,\\r\\nI fear,â\\x80\\x9d he said regretfully. â\\x80\\x9cIs it permitted to see Madame?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI guess sheâ\\x80\\x99s prostrated with the shock,â\\x80\\x9d explained Rolf.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about five minutes Poirot reappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d he said gaily. â\\x80\\x9cTo a post office. I have to send\\r\\na telegram.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho to?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLord Yardly.â\\x80\\x9d He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm\\r\\nthrough mine. â\\x80\\x9cCome, come, _mon ami_. I know all that you feel\\r\\nabout this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself!\\r\\nYou, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! _Bien!_ All\\r\\nis admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about four oâ\\x80\\x99clock when we entered Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s rooms. A figure\\r\\nrose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked\\r\\nhaggard and distraught.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI got your wire and came up at once. Look here, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been round\\r\\nto Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last\\r\\nnight, or the wire either. Do you think thatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot held up his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy excuses! I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_You_â\\x80\\x94but why? What?â\\x80\\x9d The nobleman spluttered impotently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy little idea was to bring things to a head,â\\x80\\x9d explained Poirot\\r\\nplacidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBring things to a head! Oh, my God!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lord Yardly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the ruse succeeded,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot cheerfully. â\\x80\\x9cTherefore,\\r\\n_milord_, I have much pleasure in returning youâ\\x80\\x94this!â\\x80\\x9d With a\\r\\ndramatic gesture he produced a glittering object. It was a great\\r\\ndiamond.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Star of the East,â\\x80\\x9d gasped Lord Yardly. â\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nunderstandâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo?â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cIt makes no matter. Believe me, it was necessary\\r\\nfor the diamond to be stolen. I promised you that it should be\\r\\npreserved to you, and I have kept my word. You must permit me to\\r\\nkeep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my\\r\\ndeepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to\\r\\nbe able to restore her jewel to her. What _beau temps_, is it not?\\r\\nGood day, _milord_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the\\r\\nbewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I said. â\\x80\\x9cAm I quite demented?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, _mon ami_, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you get the diamond.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom Mr. Rolf.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRolf?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mais oui!_ The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in\\r\\n_Society Gossip_, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf!\\r\\nThe two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alikeâ\\x80\\x94bah! they\\r\\ndid not exist. There was only _one_ diamond, my friend! Originally\\r\\nin the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the\\r\\npossession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance\\r\\nof a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must\\r\\nsee him on the film, he is indeed an artist, _celui-lÃ\\xa0_!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why should he steal his own diamond?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor many reasons. To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLady Yardly?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband\\r\\nwas amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an\\r\\nair about him of romance. But _au fond_, he is very business-like,\\r\\n_ce monsieur_! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed\\r\\nher. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she\\r\\nadmitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I\\r\\nbelieve her. But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could\\r\\nbe twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the\\r\\nthreat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her\\r\\nchildren, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own,\\r\\nand she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for\\r\\nthe real stone. The coincidence of the date of the appearance of\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98the Western Starâ\\x80\\x99 struck me at once. All goes well. Lord Yardly\\r\\nprepares to range himselfâ\\x80\\x94to settle down. And then comes the menace\\r\\nof the possible sale of the diamond. The substitution will be\\r\\ndiscovered. Without doubt she writes off frantically to Gregory\\r\\nRolf who has just arrived in England. He soothes her by promising\\r\\nto arrange allâ\\x80\\x94and prepares for a double robbery. In this way he\\r\\nwill quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband,\\r\\nan affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have\\r\\nÂ£50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will\\r\\nstill have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie.\\r\\nThe arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I\\r\\nfelt sure she would, immediately arranges a robberyâ\\x80\\x94and does it\\r\\nvery well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What\\r\\nhappens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the\\r\\ndoor, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams. She has\\r\\nalready wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut we saw the necklace round her neck!â\\x80\\x9d I objected.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it\\r\\nwhere the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the\\r\\ndoor beforehand is childâ\\x80\\x99s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read\\r\\nof the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well\\r\\nhe played it!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did you say to him?â\\x80\\x9d I asked with lively curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I\\r\\nwas empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not\\r\\nimmediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more\\r\\nlittle lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI pondered the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond\\r\\nthrough no fault of her own.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBah!â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot brutally. â\\x80\\x9cShe has a magnificent advertisement.\\r\\nThat is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is\\r\\ndifferent. _Bonne mÃ¨re, trÃ¨s femme!_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s views on\\r\\nfemininity. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate\\r\\nletters.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Pas du tout_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot briskly. â\\x80\\x9cShe came by the advice of\\r\\nMary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that\\r\\nMary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and\\r\\nshe changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that _you_, my friend,\\r\\noffered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that _you_\\r\\ntold her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your\\r\\nwords offered.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it,â\\x80\\x9d I cried, stung.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Si, si, mon ami_, it is a pity that you study not the psychology.\\r\\nShe told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, _never_\\r\\ndoes a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it\\r\\nwould be more prudent to do so!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all very well,â\\x80\\x9d I said, my anger rising, â\\x80\\x9cbut youâ\\x80\\x99ve made a\\r\\nperfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, itâ\\x80\\x99s all very well\\r\\nto try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart\\r\\nto shatter your illusions.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no good. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve gone a bit too far this time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ but how you enrage yourself for nothing, _mon ami_!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m fed up!â\\x80\\x9d I went out, banging the door. Poirot had made an\\r\\nabsolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp\\r\\nlesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had\\r\\nencouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return\\r\\nfound Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_A la bonne heure_, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned\\r\\nin time to accompany me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are called away on a case, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the\\r\\naffair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance\\r\\nCompany have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr. Maltravers\\r\\nwho a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum\\r\\nof fifty thousand pounds.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d I said, much interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In\\r\\nthe event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums\\r\\nwould be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the\\r\\nCompanyâ\\x80\\x99s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the\\r\\nprime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However,\\r\\non Wednesday lastâ\\x80\\x94the day before yesterdayâ\\x80\\x94the body of Mr.\\r\\nMaltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon\\r\\nManor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of\\r\\ninternal hÃ¦morrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable,\\r\\nbut sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltraversâ\\x80\\x99 financial position have\\r\\nbeen in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained\\r\\nbeyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon\\r\\nthe verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably.\\r\\nMaltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he\\r\\ngot together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying\\r\\nthe premiums on a life insurance for his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s benefit, and then\\r\\ncommitted suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my\\r\\nfriend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has\\r\\nasked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him,\\r\\nI am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had\\r\\nbeen heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure\\r\\nmay always be translated as the inability of the local G.P. to\\r\\ndiscover what his patient really did die of, but a hÃ¦morrhage seems\\r\\nfairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries.\\r\\nFive minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi\\r\\nto Liverpool Street.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the\\r\\nlittle station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded\\r\\nthe information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot\\r\\ndecided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is our plan of campaign?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFirst I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there\\r\\nis only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here\\r\\nwe are at his house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back\\r\\na little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nname. We passed up the path and rang the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nconsulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting\\r\\nfor him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and\\r\\nstooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit,\\r\\nadding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in\\r\\na case of this kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Bernard vaguely. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose, as\\r\\nhe was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou consider him a rich man, doctor?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor looked rather surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a\\r\\npretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very\\r\\ncheap.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand that he had had considerable losses of late,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nPoirot, watching the doctor narrowly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter, however, merely shook his head sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there\\r\\nis this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young\\r\\ncreature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe. A mass of\\r\\nnerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of\\r\\ncourse the shock was bound to be considerable.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear sir, I never attended him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientistâ\\x80\\x94or something\\r\\nof that kind.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you examined the body?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the cause of death was clear?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding\\r\\nmust have been internal.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas he still lying where he had been found?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, the body had not been touched. He was lying at the edge of\\r\\na small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a\\r\\nsmall rook rifle lay beside him. The hÃ¦morrhage must have occurred\\r\\nquite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo question of his having been shot, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear sir!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI demand pardon,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot humbly. â\\x80\\x9cBut, if my memory is not\\r\\nat fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a\\r\\nverdict of heart failureâ\\x80\\x94altering it when the local constable\\r\\npointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr. Maltravers,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Dr. Bernard dryly. â\\x80\\x9cNow, gentlemen, if there is nothing\\r\\nfurtherâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took the hint.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly\\r\\nanswering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an\\r\\nautopsy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly not.â\\x80\\x9d The doctor became quite apoplectic. â\\x80\\x9cThe cause of\\r\\ndeath was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress\\r\\nunduly the relatives of a dead patient.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Poirot,\\r\\nas we proceeded on our way to the Manor.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRather an old ass.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly. Your judgments of character are always profound, my\\r\\nfriend.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A\\r\\ntwinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a\\r\\nmiddle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter\\r\\nfrom the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into\\r\\na small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress. About ten\\r\\nminutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in\\r\\nwidowâ\\x80\\x99s weeds stood upon the threshold.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d she faltered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMadame!â\\x80\\x9d Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards\\r\\nher. â\\x80\\x9cI cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way.\\r\\nBut what will you? _Les affaires_â\\x80\\x94they know no mercy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were\\r\\nred with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal\\r\\nher extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and\\r\\nvery fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is something about my husbandâ\\x80\\x99s insurance, is it? But must I\\r\\nbe bothered _now_â\\x80\\x94so soon?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCourage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband\\r\\ninsured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the\\r\\nCompany always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. They have\\r\\nempowered me to act for them. You can rest assured that I will do\\r\\nall in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you.\\r\\nWill you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was changing for tea when my maid came upâ\\x80\\x94one of the gardeners\\r\\nhad just run to the house. He had foundâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the\\r\\nafternoon?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps,\\r\\nand I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShooting rooks, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard\\r\\none or two shots in the distance.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere is this little rook rifle now?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the hall, I think.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe led the way out of the room and found and handed the little\\r\\nweapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwo shots fired, I see,â\\x80\\x9d he observed, as he handed it back. â\\x80\\x9cAnd\\r\\nnow, madame, if I might seeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused delicately.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe servant shall take you,â\\x80\\x9d she murmured, averting her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with\\r\\nthe lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to\\r\\nspeak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections\\r\\nto which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot\\r\\nrejoined us.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need\\r\\nbe troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know\\r\\nanything of your husbandâ\\x80\\x99s financial position?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided\\r\\nto insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to\\r\\nwhy he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up\\r\\nhis mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition\\r\\nof his own death. I gather that he had had one hÃ¦morrhage already,\\r\\nand that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to\\r\\ndispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. Alas, he was\\r\\nonly too right!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. Poirot made\\r\\na characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien_, that is that! Back to London, my friend, there appears\\r\\nto be no mouse in this mouse-hole. And yetâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYet what?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA slight discrepancy, that is all! You noticed it? You did not?\\r\\nStill, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot\\r\\nhave taken his own lifeâ\\x80\\x94there is no poison that would fill his\\r\\nmouth with blood. No, no, I must resign myself to the fact that\\r\\nall here is clear and above-boardâ\\x80\\x94but who is this?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA tall young man was striding up the drive towards us. He passed\\r\\nus without making any sign, but I noted that he was not ill-looking,\\r\\nwith a lean, deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic\\r\\nclime. A gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a\\r\\nminute in his task, and Poirot ran quickly up to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell me, I pray you, who is that gentleman? Do you know him?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t remember his name, sir, though I did hear it. He was\\r\\nstaying down here last week for a night. Tuesday, it was.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuick, _mon ami_, let us follow him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. A glimpse of\\r\\na black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and\\r\\nour quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of\\r\\nthe meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face\\r\\nblanched noticeably.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou,â\\x80\\x9d she gasped. â\\x80\\x9cI thought you were on the seaâ\\x80\\x94on your way to\\r\\nEast Africa?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI got some news from my lawyers that detained me,â\\x80\\x9d explained the\\r\\nyoung man. â\\x80\\x9cMy old uncle in Scotland died unexpectedly and left me\\r\\nsome money. Under the circumstances I thought it better to cancel\\r\\nmy passage. Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down\\r\\nto see if there was anything I could do. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll want some one to\\r\\nlook after things for you a bit perhaps.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment they became aware of our presence. Poirot stepped\\r\\nforward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his\\r\\nstick in the hall. Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs.\\r\\nMaltravers made the necessary introduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Poirot, Captain Black.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA few minutesâ\\x80\\x99 chat ensued, in the course of which Poirot elicited\\r\\nthe fact that Captain Black was putting up at the Anchor Inn. The\\r\\nmissing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising),\\r\\nPoirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned to the village at a great pace, and Poirot made a bee\\r\\nline for the Anchor Inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere we establish ourselves until our friend the Captain returns,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe explained. â\\x80\\x9cYou notice that I emphasized the point that we were\\r\\nreturning to London by the first train? Possibly you thought I\\r\\nmeant it. But noâ\\x80\\x94you observed Mrs. Maltraversâ\\x80\\x99 face when she caught\\r\\nsight of this young Black? She was clearly taken aback, and heâ\\x80\\x94_eh\\r\\nbien_, he was very devoted, did you not think so? And he was here\\r\\non Tuesday nightâ\\x80\\x94the day before Mr. Maltravers died. We must\\r\\ninvestigate the doings of Captain Black, Hastings.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn.\\r\\nPoirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to\\r\\nthe room we had engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been telling Captain Black of the mission which brings us\\r\\nhere,â\\x80\\x9d he explained. â\\x80\\x9cYou can understand, _monsieur le capitaine_,\\r\\nthat I am anxious to arrive at Mr. Maltraversâ\\x80\\x99 state of mind\\r\\nimmediately before his death, and that at the same time I do not\\r\\nwish to distress Mrs. Maltravers unduly by asking her painful\\r\\nquestions. Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can\\r\\ngive us equally valuable information.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll do anything I can to help you, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure,â\\x80\\x9d replied the young\\r\\nsoldier; â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid I didnâ\\x80\\x99t notice anything out of the\\r\\nordinary. You see, although Maltravers was an old friend of my\\r\\npeopleâ\\x80\\x99s, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know him very well myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou came downâ\\x80\\x94when?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTuesday afternoon. I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as\\r\\nmy boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock. But some news I\\r\\ngot made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to\\r\\nMrs. Maltravers.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were returning to East Africa, I understand?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been out there ever since the Warâ\\x80\\x94a great country.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly. Now what was the talk about at dinner on Tuesday night?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. The usual odd topics. Maltravers asked after my\\r\\npeople, and then we discussed the question of German reparations,\\r\\nand then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East\\r\\nAfrica, and I told them one or two yarns, thatâ\\x80\\x99s about all, I\\r\\nthink.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: â\\x80\\x9cWith your\\r\\npermission, I should like to try a little experiment. You have told\\r\\nus all that your conscious self knows, I want now to question your\\r\\nsubconscious self.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPsychoanalysis, what?â\\x80\\x9d said Black, with visible alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot reassuringly. â\\x80\\x9cYou see, it is like this, I\\r\\ngive you a word, you answer with another, and so on. Any word, the\\r\\nfirst one you think of. Shall we begin?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right,â\\x80\\x9d said Black slowly, but he looked uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNote down the words, please, Hastings,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot. Then he took\\r\\nfrom his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table\\r\\nbeside him. â\\x80\\x9cWe will commence. Day.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a momentâ\\x80\\x99s pause, and then Black replied:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Night_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Poirot proceeded, his answers came quicker.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cName,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Place_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBernard.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Shaw_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTuesday.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Dinner_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJourney.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Ship_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCountry.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Uganda_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStory.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Lions_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRook Rifle.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Farm_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShot.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Suicide_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cElephant.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Tusks_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMoney.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Lawyers_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Captain Black. Perhaps you could spare me a few minutes\\r\\nin about half an hourâ\\x80\\x99s time?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly.â\\x80\\x9d The young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped\\r\\nhis brow as he got up.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Hastings,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, smiling at me as the door closed\\r\\nbehind him. â\\x80\\x9cYou see it all, do you not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you mean.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes that list of words tell you nothing?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI scrutinized it, but was forced to shake my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will assist you. To begin with, Black answered well within the\\r\\nnormal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he\\r\\nhimself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. â\\x80\\x98Dayâ\\x80\\x99 to â\\x80\\x98Nightâ\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Placeâ\\x80\\x99 to â\\x80\\x98Nameâ\\x80\\x99 are normal associations. I began work with\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bernardâ\\x80\\x99 which might have suggested the local doctor had he come\\r\\nacross him at all. Evidently he had not. After our recent\\r\\nconversation, he gave â\\x80\\x98Dinnerâ\\x80\\x99 to my â\\x80\\x98Tuesday,â\\x80\\x99 but â\\x80\\x98Journeyâ\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Countryâ\\x80\\x99 were answered by â\\x80\\x98Shipâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98Uganda,â\\x80\\x99 showing clearly\\r\\nthat it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not\\r\\nthe one which brought him down here. â\\x80\\x98Storyâ\\x80\\x99 recalls to him one of\\r\\nthe â\\x80\\x98Lionâ\\x80\\x99 stories he told at dinner. I proceed to â\\x80\\x98Rook Rifleâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nand he answered with the totally unexpected word â\\x80\\x98Farm.â\\x80\\x99 When I\\r\\nsay â\\x80\\x98Shot,â\\x80\\x99 he answers at once â\\x80\\x98Suicide.â\\x80\\x99 The association seems\\r\\nclear. A man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm\\r\\nsomewhere. Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he\\r\\ntold at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far\\r\\nfrom the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the\\r\\nparticular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on\\r\\nTuesday evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack was straightforward enough over the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it.\\r\\nChap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle\\r\\nthrough the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors\\r\\nwere no end puzzled over itâ\\x80\\x94there was nothing to show except a\\r\\nlittle blood on the lips. But whatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat has it got to do with Mr. Maltravers? You did not know, I\\r\\nsee, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou mean my story suggested to himâ\\x80\\x94oh, but that is awful!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not distress yourselfâ\\x80\\x94it would have been one way or another.\\r\\nWell, I must get on the telephone to London.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back\\r\\nthoughtful. He went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was\\r\\nnot till seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock that he announced that he could put it off\\r\\nno longer, but must break the news to the young widow. My sympathy\\r\\nhad already gone out to her unreservedly. To be left penniless,\\r\\nand with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to\\r\\nassure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. I\\r\\ncherished a secret hope, however, that young Black might prove\\r\\ncapable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. He\\r\\nevidently admired her enormously.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur interview with the lady was painful. She refused vehemently to\\r\\nbelieve the facts that Poirot advanced, and when she was at last\\r\\nconvinced broke down into bitter weeping. An examination of the\\r\\nbody turned our suspicions into certainty. Poirot was very sorry\\r\\nfor the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the Insurance\\r\\nCompany, and what could he do? As he was preparing to leave he said\\r\\ngently to Mrs. Maltravers:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMadame, you of all people should know that there are no dead!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d she faltered, her eyes growing wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you never taken part in any spiritualistic sÃ©ances? You are\\r\\nmediumistic, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been told so. But you do not believe in Spiritualism,\\r\\nsurely?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMadame, I have seen some strange things. You know that they say\\r\\nin the village that this house is haunted?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe nodded, and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that\\r\\ndinner was ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonâ\\x80\\x99t you just stay and have something to eat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe accepted gratefully, and I felt that our presence could not but\\r\\nhelp distract her a little from her own griefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had just finished our soup, when there was a scream outside the\\r\\ndoor, and the sound of breaking crockery. We jumped up. The\\r\\nparlourmaid appeared, her hand to her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was a manâ\\x80\\x94standing in the passage.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot rushed out, returning quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no one there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIsnâ\\x80\\x99t there, sir?â\\x80\\x9d said the parlourmaid weakly. â\\x80\\x9cOh, it did give\\r\\nme a start!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe dropped her voice to a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thoughtâ\\x80\\x94I thought it was the masterâ\\x80\\x94it looked like â\\x80\\x99im.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw Mrs. Maltravers give a terrified start, and my mind flew to\\r\\nthe old superstition that a suicide cannot rest. She thought of it\\r\\ntoo, I am sure, for a minute later, she caught Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s arm with\\r\\na scream.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDidnâ\\x80\\x99t you hear that? Those three taps on the window? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s how\\r\\n_he_ always used to tap when he passed round the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe ivy,â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cIt was the ivy against the pane.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a sort of terror was gaining on us all. The parlourmaid was\\r\\nobviously unstrung, and when the meal was over Mrs. Maltravers\\r\\nbesought Poirot not to go at once. She was clearly terrified to be\\r\\nleft alone. We sat in the little morning-room. The wind was getting\\r\\nup, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. Twice the door\\r\\nof the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each\\r\\ntime she clung to me with a terrified gasp.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, but this door, it is bewitched!â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot angrily at last. He got up and shut it once more, then\\r\\nturned the key in the lock. â\\x80\\x9cI shall lock it, so!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t do that,â\\x80\\x9d she gasped, â\\x80\\x9cif it should come open nowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even as she spoke the impossible happened. The locked door\\r\\nslowly swung open. I could not see into the passage from where I\\r\\nsat, but she and Poirot were facing it. She gave one long shriek\\r\\nas she turned to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou saw himâ\\x80\\x94there in the passage?â\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was staring down at her with a puzzled face, then shook his\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw himâ\\x80\\x94my husbandâ\\x80\\x94you must have seen him too?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMadame, I saw nothing. You are not wellâ\\x80\\x94unstrungâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am perfectly well, Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94Oh, God!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out.\\r\\nOut of the darkness came three loud raps. I could hear Mrs.\\r\\nMaltravers moaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thenâ\\x80\\x94I saw!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man I had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us,\\r\\ngleaming with a faint ghostly light. There was blood on his lips,\\r\\nand he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant\\r\\nlight seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and\\r\\nfell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and\\r\\nsomething else!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy God, Poirot!â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cLook at her hand, her right hand. Itâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nall red!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlood,â\\x80\\x9d she cried hysterically. â\\x80\\x9cYes, itâ\\x80\\x99s blood. I killed him.\\r\\nI did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger\\r\\nand pressed. Save me from himâ\\x80\\x94save me! heâ\\x80\\x99s come back!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer voice died away in a gurgle.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLights,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot briskly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lights went on as if by magic.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s it,â\\x80\\x9d he continued. â\\x80\\x9cYou heard, Hastings? And you, Everett?\\r\\nOh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the\\r\\ntheatrical profession. I â\\x80\\x99phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up\\r\\nis good, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch\\r\\nand the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression.\\r\\nI shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint\\r\\nmarks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By\\r\\nthe way, we mustnâ\\x80\\x99t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the\\r\\nwindow. A bad nightâ\\x80\\x94but he has been able to while away the time by\\r\\ntapping on the window every now and then.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see,â\\x80\\x9d continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind\\r\\nand rain, â\\x80\\x9cthere was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to\\r\\nthink the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have\\r\\ngiven him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she\\r\\nrepresented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about\\r\\nhis own health. Again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance\\r\\nof young Black? And lastly, although I know that convention decrees\\r\\nthat a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her\\r\\nhusband, I do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids! You did\\r\\nnot observe them, Hastings? No? As I always tell you, you see\\r\\nnothing!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, there it was. There were the two possibilities. Did Blackâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nstory suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to Mr.\\r\\nMaltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally\\r\\ningenious method of committing murder? I inclined to the latter\\r\\nview. To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have\\r\\nhad to pull the trigger with his toeâ\\x80\\x94or at least so I imagine.\\r\\nNow if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should\\r\\nalmost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like\\r\\nthat would have been remembered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder,\\r\\nnot suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in\\r\\nsupport of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw\\r\\nplayed to-night.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEven now I donâ\\x80\\x99t quite see all the details of the crime?â\\x80\\x9d I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us start from the beginning. Here is a shrewd and scheming\\r\\nwoman who, knowing of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s financial _dÃ©bÃ¢cle_ and tired\\r\\nof the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces\\r\\nhim to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the\\r\\nmeans to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her thatâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nyoung soldierâ\\x80\\x99s strange story. The next afternoon when _monsieur\\r\\nle capitaine_, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her\\r\\nhusband are strolling round the grounds. â\\x80\\x98What a curious story that\\r\\nwas last night!â\\x80\\x99 she observes. â\\x80\\x98Could a man shoot himself in such\\r\\na way? Do show me if it is possible!â\\x80\\x99 The poor foolâ\\x80\\x94he shows her.\\r\\nHe places the end of the rifle in his mouth. She stoops down, and\\r\\nputs her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. â\\x80\\x98And now, sir,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nshe says saucily, â\\x80\\x98supposing I pull the trigger?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd thenâ\\x80\\x94and then, Hastingsâ\\x80\\x94she pulls it!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Adventure of the Cheap Flat\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, in the cases which I have recorded, Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s investigations\\r\\nhave started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and\\r\\nhave proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to\\r\\nthe final triumphant unravelling. In the events I am now about to\\r\\nchronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the\\r\\napparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nattention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual\\r\\ncase.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald\\r\\nParker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there\\r\\nbesides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to\\r\\ndo sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject\\r\\nof house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parkerâ\\x80\\x99s special\\r\\nhobby. Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a\\r\\ndozen different flats and maisonnettes. No sooner was he settled\\r\\nanywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and\\r\\nwould forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly\\r\\nalways accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd\\r\\nbusiness head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated\\r\\nhim, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker\\r\\nfor some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then\\r\\nit was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose.\\r\\nFinally the floor was left to Mrs. Robinson, a charming little\\r\\nbride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before,\\r\\nas Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parkerâ\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTalking of flats,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9chave you heard of our piece of luck,\\r\\nMr. Parker? Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got a flatâ\\x80\\x94at last! In Montagu Mansions.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Parker, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve always said there are plenty of flatsâ\\x80\\x94at\\r\\na price!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but this isnâ\\x80\\x99t at a price. Itâ\\x80\\x99s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a\\r\\nyear!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80\\x94but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? Big\\r\\nhandsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the\\r\\nsame name stuck in the slums somewhere?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, itâ\\x80\\x99s the Knightsbridge one. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what makes it so wonderful.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonderful is the word! Itâ\\x80\\x99s a blinking miracle. But there must be\\r\\na catch somewhere. Big premium, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo premium!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo premâ\\x80\\x94oh, hold my head, somebody!â\\x80\\x9d groaned Parker.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut weâ\\x80\\x99ve got to buy the furniture,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Robinson.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d Parker brisked up. â\\x80\\x9cI knew there was a catch!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor fifty pounds. And itâ\\x80\\x99s beautifully furnished!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI give it up,â\\x80\\x9d said Parker. â\\x80\\x9cThe present occupants must be lunatics\\r\\nwith a taste for philanthropy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Robinson was looking a little troubled. A little pucker\\r\\nappeared between her dainty brows.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt _is_ queer, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? You donâ\\x80\\x99t think thatâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x94the place is\\r\\n_haunted_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever heard of a haunted flat,â\\x80\\x9d declared Parker decisively.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-o.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Robinson appeared far from convinced. â\\x80\\x9cBut there were\\r\\nseveral things about it all that struck me asâ\\x80\\x94well, queer.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor instanceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d said Parker, â\\x80\\x9cour criminal expertâ\\x80\\x99s attention is aroused!\\r\\nUnburden yourself to him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is a great\\r\\nunraveller of mysteries.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed, embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rÃ´le\\r\\nthrust upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the\\r\\nagents, Stosser and Paulâ\\x80\\x94we hadnâ\\x80\\x99t tried them before because they\\r\\nonly have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate\\r\\nit would do no harmâ\\x80\\x94everything they offered us was four and five\\r\\nhundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were\\r\\ngoing, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they\\r\\ndoubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had\\r\\nbeen on their books some time and they had sent so many people to\\r\\nsee it that it was almost sure to be takenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98snapped upâ\\x80\\x99 as the\\r\\nclerk put itâ\\x80\\x94only people were so tiresome in not letting them know,\\r\\nand then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent\\r\\nto a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then\\r\\ncontinued: â\\x80\\x9cWe thanked him, and said that we quite\\r\\nunderstood it would probably be no good, but that we should\\r\\nlike an order all the sameâ\\x80\\x94just in case. And we went there\\r\\nstraight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No.\\r\\n4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for\\r\\nthe lift, Elsie Fergusonâ\\x80\\x94sheâ\\x80\\x99s a friend of mine, Captain\\r\\nHastings, and they are looking for a flat tooâ\\x80\\x94came hurrying\\r\\ndown the stairs. â\\x80\\x98Ahead of you for once, my dear,â\\x80\\x99 she said.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98But itâ\\x80\\x99s no good. Itâ\\x80\\x99s already let.â\\x80\\x99 That seemed to finish\\r\\nit, butâ\\x80\\x94well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we\\r\\ncould afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a\\r\\npremium.â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite\\r\\nashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for\\r\\nhouse-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over\\r\\nthe higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always\\r\\napplied.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasnâ\\x80\\x99t let at\\r\\nall. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the\\r\\nmistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate\\r\\npossession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the\\r\\nagreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Robinson\\r\\npaused triumphantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what about Mrs. Ferguson?â\\x80\\x9d asked Parker. â\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s have your\\r\\ndeductions, Hastings.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Obvious, my dear Watson,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d I quoted lightly. â\\x80\\x9cShe went to the\\r\\nwrong flat.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Robinson\\r\\nadmiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rather wished Poirot had been there. Sometimes I have the feeling\\r\\nthat he rather underestimates my capabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as\\r\\na mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed\\r\\ninterested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of\\r\\nflats in various localities.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA curious story,â\\x80\\x9d he said thoughtfully. â\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, Hastings, I\\r\\nmust take a short stroll.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with\\r\\na peculiar excitement. He laid his stick on the table, and brushed\\r\\nthe nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is as well, _mon ami_, that we have no affairs of moment on\\r\\nhand. We can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat investigation are you talking about?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe remarkable cheapness of your friendâ\\x80\\x99s, Mrs. Robinsonâ\\x80\\x99s, new\\r\\nflat.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot, you are not serious!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am most serious. Figure to yourself, my friend, that the real\\r\\nrent of those flats is Â£350. I have just ascertained that from the\\r\\nlandlordâ\\x80\\x99s agents. And yet this particular flat is being sublet at\\r\\neighty pounds! Why?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere must be something wrong with it. Perhaps it is haunted, as\\r\\nMrs. Robinson suggested.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat\\r\\nis let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone\\r\\nto the wrong flat. That is the only possible solution.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may or may not be right on that point, Hastings. The fact\\r\\nstill remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it,\\r\\nand yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the\\r\\nmarket when Mrs. Robinson arrived.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat shows that there must be something wrong about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. Robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. Very curious,\\r\\nis it not? Did she impress you as being a truthful woman, Hastings?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe was a delightful creature!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Ã\\x89videmment!_ since she renders you incapable of replying to my\\r\\nquestion. Describe her to me, then.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, sheâ\\x80\\x99s tall and fair; her hairâ\\x80\\x99s really a beautiful shade of\\r\\nauburnâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlways you have had a penchant for auburn hair!â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut continue.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlue eyes and a very nice complexion andâ\\x80\\x94well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all, I\\r\\nthink,â\\x80\\x9d I concluded lamely.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd her husband?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, heâ\\x80\\x99s quite a nice fellowâ\\x80\\x94nothing startling.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDark or fair?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of\\r\\nface.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, there are hundreds of these average menâ\\x80\\x94and, anyway, you\\r\\nbring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women.\\r\\nDo you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them\\r\\nwell.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are just recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot,\\r\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t think for an instantâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot raised his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Tout doucement, mon ami_. Have I said that I think anything? All\\r\\nI say isâ\\x80\\x94it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light\\r\\nupon it; except perhaps the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s name, eh, Hastings?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHer name is Stella,â\\x80\\x9d I said stiffly, â\\x80\\x9cbut I donâ\\x80\\x99t seeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. Something seemed\\r\\nto be amusing him vastly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earthâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd stars give light! _VoilÃ\\xa0!_ Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not\\r\\nput on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu\\r\\nMansions and make a few inquiries.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI accompanied him, nothing loath. The Mansions were a handsome\\r\\nblock of buildings in excellent repair. A uniformed porter was\\r\\nsunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that Poirot\\r\\naddressed himself:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon, but could you tell me if a Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside\\r\\nhere?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or\\r\\nsuspicious disposition. He hardly looked at us and grunted out:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. 4. Second floor.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thank you. Can you tell me how long they have been here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSix months.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI started forward in amazement, conscious as I did so of Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmalicious grin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible,â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cYou must be making a mistake.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSix months.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold\\r\\nhair andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x99er,â\\x80\\x9d said the porter. â\\x80\\x9cCome in the Michaelmas quarter,\\r\\nthey did. Just six months ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the\\r\\nhall. I followed Poirot outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien_, Hastings?â\\x80\\x9d my friend demanded slyly. â\\x80\\x9cAre you so sure\\r\\nnow that delightful women always speak the truth?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him\\r\\nwhat he was going to do and where we were going.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a\\r\\nflat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting\\r\\nthings will take place there before long.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to\\r\\nbe let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it\\r\\nfor a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By\\r\\nthe way, Hastings, have you a revolver?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94somewhere,â\\x80\\x9d I answered, slightly thrilled. â\\x80\\x9cDo you thinkâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat you will need it? It is quite possible. The idea pleases you,\\r\\nI see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat\\r\\nwas pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the\\r\\nbuilding as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon,\\r\\nPoirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang\\r\\nreverberated from somewhere below.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them\\r\\nsee you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI craned my neck over the staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s them,â\\x80\\x9d I declared in an ungrammatical whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood. Wait awhile.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and\\r\\nvaried clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back\\r\\ninto the flat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Câ\\x80\\x99est Ã§a_. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat\\r\\nshould now be empty.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are we going to do?â\\x80\\x9d I asked uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at\\r\\nthe rope of the coal-lift.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nexplained cheerfully. â\\x80\\x9cNo one will observe us. The Sunday concert,\\r\\nthe Sunday â\\x80\\x98afternoon out,â\\x80\\x99 and finally the Sunday nap after the\\r\\nSunday dinner of Englandâ\\x80\\x94_le rosbif_â\\x80\\x94all these will distract\\r\\nattention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him\\r\\ngingerly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre we going to break into the flat?â\\x80\\x9d I asked dubiously.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s answer was not too reassuring:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot precisely to-day,â\\x80\\x9d he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nPulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second\\r\\nfloor. Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived\\r\\nthat the wooden door into the scullery was open.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And\\r\\nyet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night\\r\\nyesâ\\x80\\x94though not always thenâ\\x80\\x94and it is against that that we are going\\r\\nto make provision.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once\\r\\nset deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that\\r\\nit could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied\\r\\nabout three minutes. Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket,\\r\\nand we reascended once more to our own domain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the\\r\\nevening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after\\r\\nyour own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo ahead,â\\x80\\x9d I laughed. â\\x80\\x9cI presume that it is a true story, not one\\r\\nof your efforts of fancy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for\\r\\nits accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came\\r\\nto my ears. Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some\\r\\nimportant Naval plans were stolen from an American Government\\r\\ndepartment. They showed the position of some of the most important\\r\\nHarbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any\\r\\nforeign Governmentâ\\x80\\x94that of Japan, for example. Suspicion fell upon\\r\\na young man named Luigi Valdarno, an Italian by birth, who was\\r\\nemployed in a minor capacity in the Department and who was missing\\r\\nat the same time as the papers. Whether Luigi Valdarno was the\\r\\nthief or not, he was found two days later on the East Side in New\\r\\nYork, shot dead. The papers were not on him. Now for some time past\\r\\nLuigi Valdarno had been going about with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young\\r\\nconcert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a\\r\\nbrother in an apartment in Washington. Nothing was known of the\\r\\nantecedents of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about\\r\\nthe time of Valdarnoâ\\x80\\x99s death. There are reasons for believing that\\r\\nshe was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done\\r\\nmuch nefarious work under various _aliases_. The American Secret\\r\\nService, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye\\r\\nupon certain insignificant Japanese gentlemen living in Washington.\\r\\nThey felt pretty certain that, when Elsa Hardt had covered her\\r\\ntracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question.\\r\\nOne of them left suddenly for England a fortnight ago. On the face\\r\\nof it, therefore, it would seem that Elsa Hardt is in England.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nPoirot paused, and then added softly: â\\x80\\x9cThe official description of\\r\\nElsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair\\r\\ncomplexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. Robinson!â\\x80\\x9d I gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, there is a chance of it, anyhow,â\\x80\\x9d amended Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cAlso, I\\r\\nlearn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring\\r\\nabout the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, _mon\\r\\nami_, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night,\\r\\nand join me in my all-night vigil in the flat belowâ\\x80\\x94armed with that\\r\\nexcellent revolver of yours, _bien entendu_!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRather,â\\x80\\x9d I cried with enthusiasm. â\\x80\\x9cWhen shall we start?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, I fancy. Nothing\\r\\nis likely to occur before then.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift\\r\\nand lowered ourselves to the second floor. Under Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmanipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed\\r\\ninto the flat. From the scullery we passed into the kitchen where\\r\\nwe established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door\\r\\ninto the hall ajar.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow we have but to wait,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot contentedly, closing his\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me, the waiting appeared endless. I was terrified of going to\\r\\nsleep. Just when it seemed to me that I had been there about eight\\r\\nhoursâ\\x80\\x94and had, as I found out afterwards, in reality been exactly\\r\\none hour and twenty minutesâ\\x80\\x94a faint scratching sound came to my\\r\\nears. Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s hand touched mine. I rose, and together we moved\\r\\ncarefully in the direction of the hall. The noise came from there.\\r\\nPoirot placed his lips to my ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOutside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give\\r\\nthe word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast.\\r\\nBe careful, he will have a knife.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light\\r\\nappeared through the door. It was extinguished immediately and then\\r\\nthe door was slowly opened. Poirot and I flattened ourselves\\r\\nagainst the wall. I heard a manâ\\x80\\x99s breathing as he passed us. Then\\r\\nhe flashed on his torch, and as he did so, Poirot hissed in my ear:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Allez_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sprang together, Poirot with a quick movement enveloped the\\r\\nintruderâ\\x80\\x99s head with a light woollen scarf whilst I pinioned his\\r\\narms. The whole affair was quick and noiseless. I twisted a dagger\\r\\nfrom his hand, and as Poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes,\\r\\nwhilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, I jerked up my\\r\\nrevolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was\\r\\nuseless. As he ceased to struggle Poirot put his mouth close to\\r\\nhis ear and began to whisper rapidly. After a minute the man\\r\\nnodded. Then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, Poirot\\r\\nled the way out of the flat and down the stairs. Our captive\\r\\nfollowed, and I brought up the rear with the revolver. When we were\\r\\nout in the street, Poirot turned to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is a taxi waiting just round the corner. Give me the\\r\\nrevolver. We shall not need it now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut if this fellow tries to escape?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe will not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned in a minute with the waiting taxi. The scarf had been\\r\\nunwound from the strangerâ\\x80\\x99s face, and I gave a start of surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s not a Jap,â\\x80\\x9d I ejaculated in a whisper to Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cObservation was always your strong point, Hastings! Nothing\\r\\nescapes you. No, the man is not a Jap. He is an Italian.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got into the taxi, and Poirot gave the driver an address in St.\\r\\nJohnâ\\x80\\x99s Wood. I was by now completely fogged. I did not like to ask\\r\\nPoirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in\\r\\nvain to obtain some light upon the proceedings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the\\r\\nroad. A returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the\\r\\npavement and almost collided with Poirot, who said something\\r\\nsharply to him which I did not catch. All three of us went up the\\r\\nsteps of the house. Poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand\\r\\na little aside. There was no answer and he rang again and then\\r\\nseized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously.\\r\\n\\r\\nA light appeared suddenly above the fanlight, and the door was\\r\\nopened cautiously a little way.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat the devil do you want?â\\x80\\x9d a manâ\\x80\\x99s voice demanded harshly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want the doctor. My wife is taken ill.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no doctor here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man prepared to shut the door, but Poirot thrust his foot in\\r\\nadroitly. He became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated\\r\\nFrenchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat you say, there is no doctor? I will have the law of you. You\\r\\nmust come! I will stay here and ring and knock all night.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear sirâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d The door was opened again, the man, clad in a\\r\\ndressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify Poirot with\\r\\nan uneasy glance round.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will call the police.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot prepared to descend the steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, donâ\\x80\\x99t do that for Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake!â\\x80\\x9d The man dashed after him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a neat push Poirot sent him staggering down the steps. In\\r\\nanother minute all three of us were inside the door and it was\\r\\npushed to and bolted.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuickâ\\x80\\x94in here.â\\x80\\x9d Poirot led the way into the nearest room switching\\r\\non the light as he did so. â\\x80\\x9cAnd youâ\\x80\\x94behind the curtain.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSi, signor,â\\x80\\x9d said the Italian and slid rapidly behind the full\\r\\nfolds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the\\r\\nwindow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a minute too soon. Just as he disappeared from view a woman\\r\\nrushed into the room. She was tall with reddish hair and held a\\r\\nscarlet kimono round her slender form.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere is my husband?â\\x80\\x9d she cried, with a quick frightened glance.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot stepped forward with a bow.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill. I\\r\\nobserved that he had slippers on his feet, and that his dressing-gown\\r\\nwas a warm one.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho are you? What are you doing in my house?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance,\\r\\nmadame. It is especially to be regretted as one of our number has\\r\\ncome specially from New York in order to meet you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe curtains parted and the Italian stepped out. To my horror I\\r\\nobserved that he was brandishing my revolver, which Poirot must\\r\\ndoubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly, but Poirot was\\r\\nstanding in front of the closed door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet me by,â\\x80\\x9d she shrieked. â\\x80\\x9cHe will murder me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho was it dat croaked Luigi Valdarno?â\\x80\\x9d asked the Italian hoarsely,\\r\\nbrandishing the weapon, and sweeping each one of us with it. We\\r\\ndared not move.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy God, Poirot, this is awful. What shall we do?â\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will oblige me by refraining from talking so much, Hastings.\\r\\nI can assure you that our friend will not shoot until I give the\\r\\nword.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouse sure oâ\\x80\\x99 dat, eh?â\\x80\\x9d said the Italian, leering unpleasantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was more than I was, but the woman turned to Poirot like a\\r\\nflash.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it you want?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not think it is necessary to insult Miss Elsa Hardtâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nintelligence by telling her.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet\\r\\ncat which served as a cover for the telephone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are stitched in the lining of that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cClever,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot appreciatively. He stood aside from the\\r\\ndoor. â\\x80\\x9cGood evening, madame. I will detain your friend from New\\r\\nYork whilst you make your getaway.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatta fool!â\\x80\\x9d roared the big Italian, and raising the revolver he\\r\\nfired point-blank at the womanâ\\x80\\x99s retreating figure just as I flung\\r\\nmyself upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s voice rose\\r\\nin mild reproof.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever will you trust your old friend, Hastings. I do not care for\\r\\nmy friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would\\r\\nI permit a mere acquaintance to do so. No, no, _mon ami_.â\\x80\\x9d This to\\r\\nthe Italian who swearing hoarsely. Poirot continued to address him\\r\\nin a tone of mild reproof: â\\x80\\x9cSee now, what I have done for you. I\\r\\nhave saved you from being hanged. And do not think that our\\r\\nbeautiful lady will escape. No, no, the house is watched, back and\\r\\nfront. Straight into the arms of the police they will go. Is not\\r\\nthat a beautiful and consoling thought? Yes, you may leave the room\\r\\nnow. But be carefulâ\\x80\\x94be very careful. Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94Ah, he is gone! And my\\r\\nfriend Hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. But it was all\\r\\nso simple! It was clear, from the first, that out of several\\r\\nhundred, probably, applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the\\r\\nRobinsons were considered suitable. Why? What was there that\\r\\nsingled them out from the restâ\\x80\\x94at practically a glance. Their\\r\\nappearance? Possibly, but it was not so unusual. Their name, then!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing unusual about the name of Robinson,â\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s quite a common name.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! _Sapristi_, but exactly! That was the point. Elsa Hardt and\\r\\nher husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from New\\r\\nYork, and take a flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Suddenly\\r\\nthey learn that one of these secret societies, the Mafia, or the\\r\\nCamorra, to which doubtless Luigi Valdarno belonged, is on their\\r\\ntrack. What do they do? They hit on a scheme of transparent\\r\\nsimplicity. Evidently they knew that their pursuers were not\\r\\npersonally acquainted with either of them. What then can be simpler?\\r\\nThey offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. Of the thousands of\\r\\nyoung couples in London looking for flats, there cannot fail to be\\r\\nseveral Robinsons. It is only a matter of waiting. If you will look\\r\\nat the name of Robinson in the telephone directory, you will\\r\\nrealize that a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson was pretty sure to come\\r\\nalong sooner or later. Then what will happen? The avenger arrives.\\r\\nHe knows the name, he knows the address. He strikes! All is over,\\r\\nvengeance is satisfied, and Miss Elsa Hardt has escaped by the skin\\r\\nof her teeth once more. By the way, Hastings, you must present me\\r\\nto the real Mrs. Robinsonâ\\x80\\x94that delightful and truthful creature!\\r\\nWhat will they think when they find their flat has been broken\\r\\ninto! We must hurry back. Ah, that sounds like Japp and his friends\\r\\narriving.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you know this address?â\\x80\\x9d I asked as I followed Poirot out\\r\\ninto the hall. â\\x80\\x9cOh, of course, you had the first Mrs. Robinson\\r\\nfollowed when she left the other flat.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_A la bonne heure_, Hastings. You use your grey cells at last.\\r\\nNow for a little surprise for Japp.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSoftly unbolting the door, he stuck the catâ\\x80\\x99s head round the edge\\r\\nand ejaculated a piercing â\\x80\\x9cMiaow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scotland Yard inspector, who was standing outside with another\\r\\nman, jumped in spite of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, itâ\\x80\\x99s only Monsieur Poirot at one of his little jokes!â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nexclaimed, as Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s head followed that of the cat. â\\x80\\x9cLet us in,\\r\\nmoosior.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have our friends safe and sound?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, weâ\\x80\\x99ve got the birds all right. But they hadnâ\\x80\\x99t got the goods\\r\\nwith them.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see. So you come to search. Well, I am about to depart with\\r\\nHastings, but I should like to give you a little lecture upon the\\r\\nhistory and habits of the domestic cat.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor the Lordâ\\x80\\x99s sake, have you gone completely balmy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe cat,â\\x80\\x9d declaimed Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cwas worshipped by the ancient\\r\\nEgyptians. It is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black\\r\\ncat crosses your path. This cat crossed your path to-night, Japp.\\r\\nTo speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not, I\\r\\nknow, considered polite in England. But the interior of this cat\\r\\nis perfectly delicate. I refer to the lining.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a sudden grunt, the second man seized the cat from Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I forgot to introduce you,â\\x80\\x9d said Japp. â\\x80\\x9cMr. Poirot, this is\\r\\nMr. Burt of the United States Secret Service.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Americanâ\\x80\\x99s trained fingers had felt what he was looking for.\\r\\nHe held out his hand, and for a moment speech failed him. Then he\\r\\nrose to the occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPleased to meet you,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Burt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  IV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Mystery of Hunterâ\\x80\\x99s Lodge\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfter all,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cit is possible that I shall not die\\r\\nthis time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nComing from a convalescent influenza patient, I hailed the remark\\r\\nas showing a beneficial optimism. I myself had been the first\\r\\nsufferer from the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He\\r\\nwas now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head\\r\\nmuffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly\\r\\nnoxious tisane which I had prepared according to his directions.\\r\\nHis eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine\\r\\nbottles which adorned the mantelpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d my little friend continued. â\\x80\\x9cOnce more shall I be\\r\\nmyself again, the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of evil-doers!\\r\\nFigure to yourself, _mon ami_, that I have a little paragraph to\\r\\nmyself in _Society Gossip_. But yes! Here it is! â\\x80\\x98Go itâ\\x80\\x94criminalsâ\\x80\\x94all\\r\\nout! Hercule Poirotâ\\x80\\x94and believe me, girls, heâ\\x80\\x99s some Hercules!â\\x80\\x94our\\r\\nown pet society detective canâ\\x80\\x99t get a grip on you. â\\x80\\x99Cause why?\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x99Cause heâ\\x80\\x99s got _la grippe_ himselfâ\\x80\\x99!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood for you, Poirot. You are becoming quite a public character.\\r\\nAnd fortunately you havenâ\\x80\\x99t missed anything of particular interest\\r\\nduring this time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is true. The few cases I have had to decline did not fill me\\r\\nwith any regret.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOur landlady stuck her head in at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a gentleman downstairs. Says he must see Monsieur Poirot\\r\\nor you, Captain. Seeing as he was in a great to-doâ\\x80\\x94and with all\\r\\nthat quite the gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94I brought up â\\x80\\x99is card.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe handed me the bit of pasteboard. â\\x80\\x9cMr. Roger Havering,â\\x80\\x9d I read.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and I obediently\\r\\npulled forth â\\x80\\x9cWhoâ\\x80\\x99s Who.â\\x80\\x9d Poirot took it from me and scanned the\\r\\npages rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSecond son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth\\r\\ndaughter of William Crabb.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m!â\\x80\\x9d I said. â\\x80\\x9cI rather fancy thatâ\\x80\\x99s the girl who used to act at\\r\\nthe Frivolityâ\\x80\\x94only she called herself Zoe Carrisbrook. I remember\\r\\nshe married some young man about town just before the War.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould it interest you, Hastings, to go down and hear what our\\r\\nvisitorâ\\x80\\x99s particular little trouble is? Make him all my excuses.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger Havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart\\r\\nappearance. His face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently\\r\\nlabouring under great agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCaptain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s partner, I understand.\\r\\nIt is imperative that he should come with me to Derbyshire to-day.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid thatâ\\x80\\x99s impossible,â\\x80\\x9d I replied. â\\x80\\x9cPoirot is ill in\\r\\nbedâ\\x80\\x94influenza.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face fell.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear me, that is a great blow to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe matter on which you want to consult him is serious?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy God, yes! My uncle, the best friend I have in the world, was\\r\\nfoully murdered last night.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere in London?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, in Derbyshire. I was in town and received a telegram from my\\r\\nwife this morning. Immediately upon its receipt I determined to\\r\\ncome round and beg Monsieur Poirot to undertake the case.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you will excuse me a minute,â\\x80\\x9d I said, struck by a sudden idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted Poirot with\\r\\nthe situation. He took any further words out of my mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see. I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why\\r\\nnot? You should know my methods by now. All I ask is that you\\r\\nshould report to me fully every day, and follow implicitly any\\r\\ninstructions I may wire you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this I willingly agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour later I was sitting opposite Mr. Havering in a first-class\\r\\ncarriage on the Midland Railway, speeding rapidly away from London.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo begin with, Captain Hastings, you must understand that Hunterâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nLodge, where we are going, and where the tragedy took place, is\\r\\nonly a small shooting-box in the heart of the Derbyshire moors.\\r\\nOur real home is near Newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town\\r\\nfor the season. Hunterâ\\x80\\x99s Lodge is looked after by a housekeeper\\r\\nwho is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an\\r\\noccasional week-end. Of course, during the shooting season, we take\\r\\ndown some of our own servants from Newmarket. My uncle, Mr.\\r\\nHarrington Pace (as you may know, my mother was a Miss Pace of New\\r\\nYork), has, for the last three years, made his home with us. He\\r\\nnever got on well with my father, or my elder brother, and I\\r\\nsuspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather\\r\\nincreased than diminished his affection towards me. Of course I am\\r\\na poor man, and my uncle was a rich oneâ\\x80\\x94in other words, he paid\\r\\nthe piper! But, though exacting in many ways, he was not really\\r\\nhard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously\\r\\ntogether. Two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent\\r\\ngaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to\\r\\nDerbyshire for a day or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton,\\r\\nthe housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday\\r\\nevening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle\\r\\nremained on. This morning I received this telegram.â\\x80\\x9d He handed it\\r\\nover to me:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome at once uncle harrington murdered last night bring good\\r\\ndetective if you can but do comeâ\\x80\\x94Zoe.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, as yet you know no details?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I suppose it will be in the evening papers. Without doubt the\\r\\npolice are in charge.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about three oâ\\x80\\x99clock when we arrived at the little station\\r\\nof Elmerâ\\x80\\x99s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small\\r\\ngrey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA lonely place,â\\x80\\x9d I observed with a shiver.\\r\\n\\r\\nHavering nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall try and get rid of it. I could never live here again.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the\\r\\noak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJapp!â\\x80\\x9d I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scotland Yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion\\r\\nbefore addressing my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Havering, I think? Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been sent down from London to take\\r\\ncharge of this case, and Iâ\\x80\\x99d like a word with you, if I may, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy wifeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen your good lady, sirâ\\x80\\x94and the housekeeper. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t keep\\r\\nyou a moment, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m anxious to get back to the village now that\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen all there is to see here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know nothing as yet as to whatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEx-actly,â\\x80\\x9d said Japp soothingly. â\\x80\\x9cBut there are just one or two\\r\\nlittle points Iâ\\x80\\x99d like your opinion about all the same. Captain\\r\\nHastings here, he knows me, and heâ\\x80\\x99ll go on up to the house and\\r\\ntell them youâ\\x80\\x99re coming. What have you done with the little man,\\r\\nby the way, Captain Hastings?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s ill in bed with influenza.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs he now? Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry to hear that. Rather the case of the cart\\r\\nwithout the horse, your being here without him, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang\\r\\nthe bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some\\r\\nmoments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Havering will be here in a moment,â\\x80\\x9d I explained. â\\x80\\x9cHe has been\\r\\ndetained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London\\r\\nto look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred\\r\\nlast night.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome inside, sir.â\\x80\\x9d She closed the door behind me, and we stood in\\r\\nthe dimly-lighted hall. â\\x80\\x9cIt was after dinner last night, sir, that\\r\\nthe man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he\\r\\nspoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend\\r\\nof Mr. Paceâ\\x80\\x99s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to\\r\\ntell Mr. Pace. He wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t give any name, which, of course, was a\\r\\nbit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed\\r\\npuzzled like, but he said to the mistress: â\\x80\\x98Excuse me, Zoe, while\\r\\nI just see what this fellow wants.â\\x80\\x99 He went off to the gun-room,\\r\\nand I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud\\r\\nvoices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall.\\r\\nAt the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then\\r\\nthere was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the\\r\\ngun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the\\r\\nwindow. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and\\r\\nbleeding.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat became of the man?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to\\r\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it\\r\\nwas. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night,\\r\\nand this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper reflected.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on\\r\\na light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American\\r\\nI didnâ\\x80\\x99t notice much about him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see. Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector\\r\\nJapp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from\\r\\nLondon is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had\\r\\ntwo or three hoursâ\\x80\\x99 start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made\\r\\nme keen to be close at his heels.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I\\r\\nheard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a\\r\\nvery handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a\\r\\nflame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her\\r\\nfigure. On her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather.\\r\\nEven the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her\\r\\npersonality.\\r\\n\\r\\nI introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I have often heard of you and your colleague, Monsieur\\r\\nPoirot. You have done some wonderful things together, havenâ\\x80\\x99t you?\\r\\nIt was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now will\\r\\nyou ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it, of getting\\r\\nto know all you want to about this dreadful affair?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Mrs. Havering. Now what time was it that this man\\r\\narrived?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt must have been just before nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock. We had finished\\r\\ndinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour husband had already left for London?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he went up by the 6.15.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid he go by car to the station, or did he walk?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOur own car isnâ\\x80\\x99t down here. One came out from the garage in\\r\\nElmerâ\\x80\\x99s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas Mr. Pace quite his usual self?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely. Most normal in every way.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, can you describe this visitor at all?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid not. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him\\r\\nstraight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did your uncle say?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five\\r\\nminutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out\\r\\ninto the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we\\r\\nheard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we\\r\\nhad to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took\\r\\nsome time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor\\r\\nuncleâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94her voice falteredâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9chad been shot through the head. I saw\\r\\nat once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I\\r\\nwas careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly\\r\\nas I found it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded approval.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, as to the weapon?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of\\r\\nrevolvers of my husbandâ\\x80\\x99s were mounted upon the wall. One of them\\r\\nis missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the\\r\\nother one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I\\r\\nsuppose they will know for certain.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay I go to the gun-room?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been\\r\\nremoved.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering\\r\\nentered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I\\r\\nwas left to undertake my investigations alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing.\\r\\nIn detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing\\r\\nthat struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on\\r\\nthe carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined\\r\\neverything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of\\r\\nthe room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also\\r\\nexamined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have\\r\\nbeen so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to\\r\\nwaste time over it. No, I had seen all that Hunterâ\\x80\\x99s Lodge had to\\r\\nshow me. I must go back to Elmerâ\\x80\\x99s Dale and get into touch with\\r\\nJapp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven\\r\\noff in the car that had brought us up from the station.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found Japp at the Matlock Arms and he took me forthwith to see\\r\\nthe body. Harrington Pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man,\\r\\ntypically American in appearance. He had been shot through the back\\r\\nof the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTurned away for a moment,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Japp, â\\x80\\x9cand the other fellow\\r\\nsnatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed\\r\\nover to us was fully loaded and I suppose the other one was also.\\r\\nCurious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded\\r\\nrevolvers hanging up on your wall.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think of the case?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, as we left the gruesome\\r\\nchamber behind us.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!â\\x80\\x9d noting\\r\\nmy exclamation of astonishment. â\\x80\\x9cHavering has one or two shady\\r\\nincidents in his past. When he was a boy at Oxford there was some\\r\\nfunny business about the signature on one of his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s cheques.\\r\\nAll hushed up of course. Then, heâ\\x80\\x99s pretty heavily in debt now,\\r\\nand theyâ\\x80\\x99re the kind of debts he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t like to go to his uncle\\r\\nabout, whereas you may be sure the uncleâ\\x80\\x99s will would be in his\\r\\nfavour. Yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99d got my eye on him, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I wanted to\\r\\nspeak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail\\r\\nall right, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been to the station and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no doubt\\r\\nwhatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about\\r\\n10.30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nconfirmed all rightâ\\x80\\x94why, he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been shooting his uncle\\r\\nhere at nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock in a black beard!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, yes, I was going to ask you what you thought about that\\r\\nbeard?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJapp winked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think it grew pretty fastâ\\x80\\x94grew in the five miles from Elmerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nDale to Hunterâ\\x80\\x99s Lodge. Americans that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve met are mostly\\r\\nclean-shaven. Yes, itâ\\x80\\x99s amongst Mr. Paceâ\\x80\\x99s American associates that\\r\\nweâ\\x80\\x99ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper\\r\\nfirst, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right,\\r\\nbut Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry Mrs. Havering didnâ\\x80\\x99t get a look at the fellow. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\na smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set\\r\\nus on the track.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was\\r\\nable to add various further items of information before I posted\\r\\nthe letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired\\r\\nfrom a revolver identical with the one held by the police.\\r\\nFurthermore, Mr. Haveringâ\\x80\\x99s movements on the night in question had\\r\\nbeen checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he\\r\\nhad actually arrived in London by the train in question. And,\\r\\nthirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman,\\r\\nliving at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District\\r\\nRailway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel\\r\\nstuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained\\r\\na revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station,\\r\\nand before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of,\\r\\nthe fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been\\r\\nfired from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this I added to my report. A wire from Poirot arrived whilst\\r\\nI was at breakfast the following morning:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course black bearded man was not Havering only you or Japp\\r\\nwould have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what\\r\\nclothes she wore this morning same of Mrs. Havering do not waste\\r\\ntime taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not\\r\\nin the least artistic.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed to me that Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s style was unnecessarily facetious.\\r\\nI also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot\\r\\nwith full facilities for handling the case. His request for a\\r\\ndescription of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to\\r\\nbe simply ridiculous, but I complied as well as I, a mere man, was\\r\\nable to.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt eleven a reply wire came from Poirot:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAdvise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDumbfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his\\r\\nbreath.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, thereâ\\x80\\x99s something\\r\\nin it. And I hardly noticed the woman. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that I can go\\r\\nso far as arresting her, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have her watched. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll go up\\r\\nright away, and take another look at her.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman,\\r\\nwho had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin\\r\\nair. Her box had been left behind. It contained only ordinary\\r\\nwearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to\\r\\nher whereabouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former\\r\\nhousekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourneâ\\x80\\x99s Agency in\\r\\nMount Streetâ\\x80\\x94a very well-known place. I get all my servants from\\r\\nthere. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton\\r\\nseemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her\\r\\non the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe\\r\\nthat there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet\\r\\nwoman.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the\\r\\nwoman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the\\r\\nmoment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall,\\r\\nnevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why\\r\\nshould she suddenly take to her heels and bolt?\\r\\n\\r\\nI wired the latest development to Poirot and suggested returning\\r\\nto London and making inquiries at Selbourneâ\\x80\\x99s Agency.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s reply was prompt:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUseless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her\\r\\nfind out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first\\r\\narrived there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThough mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nDale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars,\\r\\nand there were two station flies. None of these had been\\r\\nrequisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering\\r\\nexplained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down\\r\\nto Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up\\r\\nto Hunterâ\\x80\\x99s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the\\r\\nstation on the chance of its being required. Taking into\\r\\nconsideration the further fact that nobody at the station had\\r\\nnoticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on\\r\\nthe fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion\\r\\nthat the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been\\r\\nwaiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had\\r\\nbrought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. I may mention\\r\\nthat inquiries at the Agency in London bore out Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nprognostication. No such woman as â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Middletonâ\\x80\\x9d had ever been\\r\\non their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs. Haveringâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\napplication for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants\\r\\nfor the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted\\r\\nto mention which woman she had selected.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot\\r\\nestablished in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk\\r\\ndressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon ami_ Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have\\r\\nfor you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have\\r\\nrun to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and\\r\\ninvestigated to your heartâ\\x80\\x99s content?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I cried, â\\x80\\x9cthe thingâ\\x80\\x99s a dark mystery! It will never be\\r\\nsolved.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory\\r\\nover it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a hard nut to crack.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A\\r\\nveritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know\\r\\nwell enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know? How did you find out?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth.\\r\\nSee here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in\\r\\norder. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune\\r\\nwhich at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. Point No. 1.\\r\\nHis nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His\\r\\nnephew is also known to beâ\\x80\\x94shall we say a man of rather loose\\r\\nmoral fibre? Point No. 3.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to\\r\\nLondon.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_PrÃ©cisÃ©ment_â\\x80\\x94and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmerâ\\x80\\x99s Dale at\\r\\n6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left,\\r\\nor the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being\\r\\ngiven wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly,\\r\\nthat Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs.\\r\\nHavering, Hastings.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe will be found.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that\\r\\nhousekeeper, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of\\r\\ntime.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what was her part?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just\\r\\nmentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the\\r\\nshot was fired. And no one will ever find her, _mon ami_, because\\r\\nshe does not exist! â\\x80\\x98Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no sech person,â\\x80\\x99 as your so great\\r\\nShakespeare says.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was Dickens,â\\x80\\x9d I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. â\\x80\\x9cBut what\\r\\ndo you mean, Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that\\r\\nyou and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim\\r\\nmiddle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally\\r\\nthat neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper\\r\\nfetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the\\r\\nsame time. It was childâ\\x80\\x99s play for that clever and daring woman.\\r\\nOn the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips\\r\\non a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she\\r\\njams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and\\r\\nthe make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant\\r\\nZoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks\\r\\nparticularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing\\r\\nto connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could\\r\\nnot have placed it there?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, that was Roger Haveringâ\\x80\\x99s jobâ\\x80\\x94but it was a mistake on their\\r\\npart. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a\\r\\nmurder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it\\r\\naway at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the\\r\\nmotive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of\\r\\nthe police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious\\r\\nto get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of\\r\\nHunterâ\\x80\\x99s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the\\r\\none with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one\\r\\nshot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club\\r\\nto establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the\\r\\ndistrict, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel\\r\\nwhere it was found and so back to town. That charming creature,\\r\\nhis wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinnerâ\\x80\\x94you remember he was\\r\\nshot from behind? Another significant point, that!â\\x80\\x94reloads the\\r\\nrevolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with\\r\\nher desperate little comedy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s incredible,â\\x80\\x9d I murmured, fascinated, â\\x80\\x9cand yetâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet it is true. _Bien sur_, my friend, it is true. But to\\r\\nbring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well,\\r\\nJapp must do what he canâ\\x80\\x94I have written him fullyâ\\x80\\x94but I very much\\r\\nfear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or\\r\\n_le bon Dieu_, whichever you prefer.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe wicked flourish like a green bay tree,â\\x80\\x9d I reminded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut at a price, Hastings, always at a price, _croyez-moi!_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the\\r\\ntruth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary\\r\\nevidence to ensure a conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Paceâ\\x80\\x99s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers.\\r\\nNevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the\\r\\npaper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those\\r\\nkilled in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice\\r\\nwas satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  V\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Million Dollar Bond Robbery\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a number of bond robberies there have been lately!â\\x80\\x9d I observed\\r\\none morning, laying aside the newspaper. â\\x80\\x9cPoirot, let us forsake\\r\\nthe science of detection, and take to crime instead!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are on theâ\\x80\\x94how do you say it?â\\x80\\x94get-rich-quick tack, eh, _mon\\r\\nami_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, look at this last _coup_, the million dollarsâ\\x80\\x99 worth of\\r\\nLiberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to\\r\\nNew York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on\\r\\nboard the _Olympia_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf it were not for the _mal de mer_, and the difficulty of\\r\\npractising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time\\r\\nthan the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to\\r\\nvoyage myself on one of these big liners,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot dreamily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed,â\\x80\\x9d I said enthusiastically. â\\x80\\x9cSome of them must be\\r\\nperfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant,\\r\\nthe palm courtsâ\\x80\\x94really, it must be hard to believe that one is on\\r\\nthe sea.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMe, I always know when I am on the sea,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot sadly. â\\x80\\x9cAnd\\r\\nall those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me;\\r\\nbut, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as\\r\\nit were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so\\r\\njustly call them, one would meet the Ã©lite, the _haute noblesse_\\r\\nof the criminal world!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo thatâ\\x80\\x99s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to\\r\\ncross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlady interrupted us.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s her card.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe card bore the inscription: Miss EsmÃ©e Farquhar, and Poirot,\\r\\nafter diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting\\r\\nit carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to\\r\\nadmit her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen\\r\\nwas ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty,\\r\\nwith big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and\\r\\nperfectly composed in manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain\\r\\nHastings, who aids me in my little problems.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur\\r\\nPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated\\r\\nherself. â\\x80\\x9cI dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am\\r\\nreferring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the _Olympia_.â\\x80\\x9d Some\\r\\nastonishment must have shown itself in Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s face, for she\\r\\ncontinued quickly: â\\x80\\x9cYou are doubtless asking yourself what I have\\r\\nto do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank.\\r\\nIn one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur\\r\\nPoirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAha! and Mr. Philip Ridgewayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. Of course no\\r\\nactual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way.\\r\\nNevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle,\\r\\nI know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them\\r\\nin his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho is his uncle?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish\\r\\nBank.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits\\r\\nin America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million\\r\\ndollars in Liberty Bonds. Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who\\r\\nhad occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and\\r\\nwho was conversant with all the details of the Bankâ\\x80\\x99s dealings in\\r\\nNew York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on\\r\\nthe 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning\\r\\nof that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general\\r\\nmanagers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted,\\r\\nenclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then\\r\\nlocked the package at once in his portmanteau.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA portmanteau with an ordinary lock?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by\\r\\nHubbsâ\\x80\\x99s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the\\r\\ntrunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A\\r\\nrigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result.\\r\\nThe bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot made a grimace.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were\\r\\nsold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the\\r\\n_Olympia_! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr.\\r\\nRidgeway.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Cheshire Cheese.â\\x80\\x99 Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does\\r\\nnot yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a\\r\\ntaxi.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat\\r\\nsurprised to see his fiancÃ©e arriving with two complete strangers.\\r\\nHe was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch\\r\\nof greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much\\r\\nover thirty.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,â\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nsaid. â\\x80\\x9cLet me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom\\r\\nyou must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRidgeway looked very astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d he said, as he\\r\\nshook hands. â\\x80\\x9cBut I had no idea that EsmÃ©e was thinking of\\r\\nconsulting you about myâ\\x80\\x94our trouble.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss\\r\\nFarquhar meekly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo you took care to be on the safe side,â\\x80\\x9d he observed, with a\\r\\nsmile. â\\x80\\x9cI hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on\\r\\nthis extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly\\r\\nout of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too\\r\\nclearly the strain under which he was labouring.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, well,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cLet us lunch, and over lunch we will\\r\\nput our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear\\r\\nMr. Ridgewayâ\\x80\\x99s story from his own lips.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the\\r\\nestablishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading\\r\\nto the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with that of\\r\\nMiss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot\\r\\ntook up the thread with a question.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen,\\r\\nMr. Ridgeway?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed rather bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have\\r\\nmissed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all\\r\\nscratched and cut about where theyâ\\x80\\x99d tried to force the lock.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I understood that it had been opened with a key?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s so. They tried to force it, but couldnâ\\x80\\x99t. And, in the end,\\r\\nthey must have got it unlocked somehow or other.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCurious,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the\\r\\ngreen light I knew so well. â\\x80\\x9cVery curious! They waste much, much\\r\\ntime trying to prise it open, and thenâ\\x80\\x94_sapristi!_ they find that\\r\\nthey have the key all the timeâ\\x80\\x94for each of Hubbsâ\\x80\\x99s locks are\\r\\nunique.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s just why they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have had the key. It never left me\\r\\nday or night.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are sure of that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a\\r\\nduplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously\\r\\nunforceable lock?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I\\r\\nventure to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will\\r\\nhinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I\\r\\nask you one more question: _Are you perfectly certain you did not\\r\\nleave the trunk unlocked?_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated\\r\\napologetically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the\\r\\nbonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them?\\r\\nHow did he manage to get ashore with them?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d cried Ridgeway. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s just it. How? Word was passed to the\\r\\nCustoms authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone\\r\\nover with a toothcomb!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly they did. They could hardly have been hidden on boardâ\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nanyway we know they werenâ\\x80\\x99t because they were offered for sale\\r\\nwithin half an hour of the _Olympiaâ\\x80\\x99s_ arrival, long before I got\\r\\nthe cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he\\r\\nbought some of them even before the _Olympia_ got in. But you canâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsend bonds by wireless.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given\\r\\nwhen every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for\\r\\ntheir being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur\\r\\nPoirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say\\r\\nI stole them myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you also were searched on landing, werenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d asked Poirot\\r\\ngently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man stared at him in a puzzled manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou do not catch my meaning, I see,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, smiling\\r\\nenigmatically. â\\x80\\x9cNow I should like to make a few inquiries at the\\r\\nBank.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRidgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSend this in and my uncle will see you at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together\\r\\nwe started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of the\\r\\nLondon and Scottish Bank. On production of Ridgewayâ\\x80\\x99s card, we were\\r\\nled through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in\\r\\nclerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first\\r\\nfloor where the joint general managers received us. They were two\\r\\ngrave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank.\\r\\nMr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\nVavasour. â\\x80\\x9cQuite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves\\r\\nin the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the\\r\\ncase. A very able officer, I believe.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am sure of it,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot politely. â\\x80\\x9cYou will permit a few\\r\\nquestions, on your nephewâ\\x80\\x99s behalf? About this lock, who ordered\\r\\nit from Hubbsâ\\x80\\x99s?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI ordered it myself,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Shaw. â\\x80\\x9cI would not trust to any\\r\\nclerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the\\r\\nother two are held by my colleague and myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd no clerk has had access to them?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. â\\x80\\x9cI think I am correct\\r\\nin saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them\\r\\non the 23rd,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Vavasour. â\\x80\\x9cMy colleague was unfortunately\\r\\ntaken ill a fortnight agoâ\\x80\\x94in fact on the very day that Philip left\\r\\nus. He has only just recovered.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSevere bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Shaw\\r\\nruefully. â\\x80\\x9cBut I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard\\r\\nwork entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry\\r\\ncoming on top of everything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring\\r\\nto gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew.\\r\\nMr. Vavasourâ\\x80\\x99s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was\\r\\na trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money\\r\\ndifficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar\\r\\nmissions in the past. Finally we were politely bowed out.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am disappointed,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, as we emerged into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not their stodginess which disappoints me, _mon ami_. I do\\r\\nnot expect to find in a Bank manager a â\\x80\\x98keen financier with an\\r\\neagle glanceâ\\x80\\x99 as your favourite works of fiction put it. No, I am\\r\\ndisappointed in the caseâ\\x80\\x94it is too easy!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEasy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know who stole the bonds?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut thenâ\\x80\\x94we mustâ\\x80\\x94whyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not confuse and fluster yourself, Hastings. We are not going\\r\\nto do anything at present.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why? What are you waiting for?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor the _Olympia_. She is due on her return trip from New York on\\r\\nTuesday.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? He may escape.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo a South Sea island where there is no extradition? No, _mon\\r\\nami_, he would find life very uncongenial there. As to why I\\r\\nwaitâ\\x80\\x94_eh bien_ to the intelligence of Hercule Poirot the case is\\r\\nperfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly\\r\\ngifted by the good Godâ\\x80\\x94the Inspector McNeil, for instanceâ\\x80\\x94it would\\r\\nbe as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. One must\\r\\nhave consideration for those less gifted than oneself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood Lord, Poirot! Do you know, Iâ\\x80\\x99d give a considerable sum of\\r\\nmoney to see you make a thorough ass of yourselfâ\\x80\\x94just for once.\\r\\nYouâ\\x80\\x99re so confoundedly conceited!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not enrage yourself, Hastings. In verity, I observe that there\\r\\nare times when you almost detest me! Alas, I suffer the penalties\\r\\nof greatness!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically that\\r\\nI was forced to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nTuesday saw us speeding to Liverpool in a first-class carriage of\\r\\nthe L. & N.W.R. Poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as\\r\\nto his suspicionsâ\\x80\\x94or certainties. He contented himself with\\r\\nexpressing surprise that I, too, was not equally _au fait_ with\\r\\nthe situation. I disdained to argue, and entrenched my curiosity\\r\\nbehind a rampart of pretended indifference.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic\\r\\nliner, Poirot became brisk and alert. Our proceedings consisted in\\r\\ninterviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend\\r\\nof Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s who had crossed to New York on the 23rd.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn elderly gentleman, wearing glasses. A great invalid, hardly\\r\\nmoved out of his cabin.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe description appeared to tally with one Mr. Ventnor who had\\r\\noccupied the cabin C 24 which was next to that of Philip Ridgeway.\\r\\nAlthough unable to see how Poirot had deduced Mr. Ventnorâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nexistence and personal appearance, I was keenly excited.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell me,â\\x80\\x9d I cried, â\\x80\\x9cwas this gentleman one of the first to land\\r\\nwhen you got to New York?â\\x80\\x9d The steward shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed, sir, he was one of the last off the boat.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI retired crestfallen, and observed Poirot grinning at me. He\\r\\nthanked the steward, a note changed hands, and we took our\\r\\ndeparture.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all very well,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked heatedly, â\\x80\\x9cbut that last answer\\r\\nmust have damped your precious theory, grin as you please!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs usual, you see nothing, Hastings. That last answer is, on the\\r\\ncontrary, the coping-stone of my theory.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI flung up my hands in despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI give it up.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we were in the train, speeding towards London, Poirot wrote\\r\\nbusily for a few minutes, sealing up the result in an envelope.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is for the good Inspector McNeil. We will leave it at Scotland\\r\\nYard in passing, and then to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where I\\r\\nhave asked Miss EsmÃ©e Farquhar to do us the honour of dining with\\r\\nus.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat about Ridgeway?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat about him?â\\x80\\x9d asked Poirot with a twinkle.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, you surely donâ\\x80\\x99t thinkâ\\x80\\x94you canâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a\\r\\nmatter of fact I _did_ think. If Ridgeway had been the thiefâ\\x80\\x94which\\r\\nwas perfectly possibleâ\\x80\\x94the case would have been charming; a piece\\r\\nof neat methodical work.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut not so charming for Miss Farquhar.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPossibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now,\\r\\nHastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying to\\r\\ndo so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes,\\r\\nas Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air. We will dismiss the thin\\r\\nair theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of\\r\\nscience, and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every\\r\\none asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashoreâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but we knowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_You_ may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that, since\\r\\nit seemed incredible, it _was_ incredible. Two possibilities\\r\\nremain: it was hidden on boardâ\\x80\\x94also rather difficultâ\\x80\\x94or it was\\r\\nthrown overboard.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith a cork on it, do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWithout a cork.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been\\r\\nsold in New York.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in New\\r\\nYork, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where that\\r\\nleads us?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere we were when we started.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Jamais de la vie!_ If the package was thrown overboard, and the\\r\\nbonds were sold in New York, the package could not have contained\\r\\nthe bonds. Is there any evidence that the package _did_ contain\\r\\nthe bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from the time it\\r\\nwas placed in his hands in London.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but thenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot waved an impatient hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPermit me to continue. The last moment that the bonds are seen as\\r\\nbonds is in the office of the London and Scottish Bank on the\\r\\nmorning of the 23rd. They reappear in New York half an hour after\\r\\nthe _Olympia_ gets in, and according to one man, whom nobody\\r\\nlistens to, actually _before_ she gets in. Supposing then, that\\r\\nthey have never been on the _Olympia_ at all? Is there any other\\r\\nway they could get to New York? Yes. The _Gigantic_ leaves\\r\\nSouthampton on the same day as the _Olympia_, and she holds the\\r\\nrecord for the Atlantic. Mailed by the _Gigantic_, the bonds would\\r\\nbe in New York the day before the _Olympia_ arrived. All is clear,\\r\\nthe case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a\\r\\ndummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in\\r\\nthe Bank. It would be an easy matter for any of the three men\\r\\npresent to have prepared a duplicate package which could be\\r\\nsubstituted for the genuine one. _TrÃ¨s bien_, the bonds are mailed\\r\\nto a confederate in New York, with instructions to sell as soon as\\r\\nthe _Olympia_ is in, but some one must travel on the _Olympia_ to\\r\\nengineer the supposed moment of the robbery.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause if Ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy,\\r\\nsuspicion flies at once to London. No, the man on board in the\\r\\ncabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an\\r\\nobvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft,\\r\\nreally unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package\\r\\noverboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. Naturally he\\r\\nwears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does\\r\\nnot want to run the risk of meeting Ridgeway. He steps ashore in\\r\\nNew York and returns by the first boat available.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut whoâ\\x80\\x94which was he?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock,\\r\\nthe man who has _not_ been severely ill with bronchitis at his home\\r\\nin the countryâ\\x80\\x94_enfin_, that â\\x80\\x98stodgyâ\\x80\\x99 old man, Mr. Shaw! There are\\r\\ncriminals in high places sometimes, my friend. Ah, here we are.\\r\\nMademoiselle, I have succeeded! You permit?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, beaming, Poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either\\r\\ncheek!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  VI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic\\r\\nof the many adventures I have shared with Poirot was that of our\\r\\ninvestigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon\\r\\nthe discovery and opening of the Tomb of King Men-her-Ra.\\r\\n\\r\\nHard upon the discovery of the Tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen by Lord\\r\\nCarnarvon, Sir John Willard and Mr. Bleibner of New York, pursuing\\r\\ntheir excavations not far from Cairo, in the vicinity of the\\r\\nPyramids of Gizeh, came unexpectedly on a series of funeral\\r\\nchambers. The greatest interest was aroused by their discovery.\\r\\nThe Tomb appeared to be that of King Men-her-Ra, one of those\\r\\nshadowy kings of the Eighth Dynasty, when the Old Kingdom was\\r\\nfalling to decay. Little was known about this period, and the\\r\\ndiscoveries were fully reported in the newspapers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public\\r\\nmind. Sir John Willard died quite suddenly of heart failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity\\r\\nof reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the\\r\\nill luck of certain Egyptian treasures. The unlucky Mummy at the\\r\\nBritish Museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh\\r\\nzest, was quietly denied by the Museum, but nevertheless enjoyed\\r\\nall its usual vogue.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fortnight later Mr. Bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and\\r\\na few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in New York.\\r\\nThe â\\x80\\x9cCurse of Men-her-Raâ\\x80\\x9d was the talk of the day, and the magic\\r\\npower of dead and gone Egypt was exalted to a fetish point.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was then that Poirot received a brief note from Lady Willard,\\r\\nwidow of the dead archaeologist, asking him to go and see her at\\r\\nher house in Kensington Square. I accompanied him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Willard was a tall, thin woman, dressed in deep mourning. Her\\r\\nhaggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is kind of you to have come so promptly, Monsieur Poirot.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am at your service, Lady Willard. You wished to consult me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are, I am aware, a detective, but it is not only as a detective\\r\\nthat I wish to consult you. You are a man of original views, I\\r\\nknow, you have imagination, experience of the world, tell me,\\r\\nMonsieur Poirot, what are your views on the supernatural?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot hesitated for a moment before he replied. He seemed to be\\r\\nconsidering. Finally he said:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us not misunderstand each other, Lady Willard. It is not a\\r\\ngeneral question that you are asking me there. It has a personal\\r\\napplication, has it not? You are referring obliquely to the death\\r\\nof your late husband?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is so,â\\x80\\x9d she admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou want me to investigate the circumstances of his death?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper\\r\\nchatter, and how much may be said to be founded on fact? Three\\r\\ndeaths, Monsieur Poirotâ\\x80\\x94each one explicable taken by itself, but\\r\\ntaken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence, and all\\r\\nwithin a month of the opening of the tomb! It may be mere\\r\\nsuperstition, it may be some potent curse from the past that\\r\\noperates in ways undreamed of by modern science. The fact\\r\\nremainsâ\\x80\\x94three deaths! And I am afraid, Monsieur Poirot, horribly\\r\\nafraid. It may not yet be the end.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor whom do you fear?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor my son. When the news of my husbandâ\\x80\\x99s death came I was ill.\\r\\nMy son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He\\r\\nbrought theâ\\x80\\x94the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite\\r\\nof my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that\\r\\nhe intends to take his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s place and carry on the system of\\r\\nexcavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but,\\r\\nMonsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead\\r\\nKing is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking\\r\\nnonsenseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed, Lady Willard,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot quickly. â\\x80\\x9cI, too, believe\\r\\nin the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world\\r\\nhas ever known.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot\\r\\nwith being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in\\r\\nearnest.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will\\r\\ndo my utmost to keep him from harm.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many\\r\\nways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we\\r\\nmoderns with all our boasted science. Now let us come to facts,\\r\\nthat I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted\\r\\nEgyptologist, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living\\r\\nauthorities upon the subject.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any\\r\\nsubject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to\\r\\ninterest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful\\r\\nin financing the expedition.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the\\r\\nparty at all?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I\\r\\nread of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner\\r\\ncan have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any\\r\\nrelations.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho are the other members of the party?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the\\r\\nBritish Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New\\r\\nYork; a young American secretary; Dr. Ames, who accompanies the\\r\\nexpedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husbandâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndevoted native servant.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you remember the name of the American secretary?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr.\\r\\nBleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Lady Willard.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf there is anything elseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured\\r\\nthat I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard\\r\\nwince as he uttered them. Yet, at the same time, the fact that he\\r\\nhad not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my part I had never before suspected that Poirot had so deep\\r\\na vein of superstition in his nature. I tackled him on the subject\\r\\nas we went homewards. His manner was grave and earnest.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut yes, Hastings. I believe in these things. You must not\\r\\nunderrate the force of superstition.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are we going to do about it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Toujours pratique_, the good Hastings! _Eh bien_, to begin with\\r\\nwe are going to cable to New York for fuller details of young Mr.\\r\\nBleibnerâ\\x80\\x99s death.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe duly sent off his cable. The reply was full and precise. Young\\r\\nRupert Bleibner had been in low water for several years. He had\\r\\nbeen a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea\\r\\nislands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had\\r\\nrapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my\\r\\nmind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to\\r\\ntake him to Egypt. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve a good friend there I can borrow from,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had\\r\\nreturned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared\\r\\nmore for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and\\r\\nblood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir\\r\\nJohn Willard occurred. Rupert had plunged once more into his life\\r\\nof dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had\\r\\ncommitted suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some\\r\\ncurious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He\\r\\nreferred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended\\r\\nby declaring that such as he were better dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed\\r\\nin the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more\\r\\nmodern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with\\r\\nhis uncleâ\\x80\\x94preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard\\r\\nreceives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted\\r\\nby his crime. The news of his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s death reaches him. He realizes\\r\\nhow unnecessary his crime has been, and stricken with remorse takes\\r\\nhis own life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI outlined my solution to Poirot. He was interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is ingenious what you have thought of thereâ\\x80\\x94decidedly it is\\r\\ningenious. It may even be true. But you leave out of count the\\r\\nfatal influence of the Tomb.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI shrugged my shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou still think that has something to do with it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo much so, _mon ami_, that we start for Egypt to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d I cried, astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have said it.â\\x80\\x9d An expression of conscious heroism spread over\\r\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s face. Then he groaned. â\\x80\\x9cBut, oh,â\\x80\\x9d he lamented, â\\x80\\x9cthe sea!\\r\\nThe hateful sea!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the\\r\\ndesert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of\\r\\nmisery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller.\\r\\nOur four daysâ\\x80\\x99 voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to\\r\\nhim. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self,\\r\\neven his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo\\r\\nand had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the\\r\\nshadow of the Pyramids.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charm of Egypt had laid hold of me. Not so Poirot. Dressed\\r\\nprecisely the same as in London, he carried a small clothes-brush\\r\\nin his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which\\r\\naccumulated on his dark apparel.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd my boots,â\\x80\\x9d he wailed. â\\x80\\x9cRegard them, Hastings. My boots, of\\r\\nthe neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. See, the\\r\\nsand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which\\r\\noutrages the eyesight. Also the heat, it causes my moustaches to\\r\\nbecome limpâ\\x80\\x94but limp!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook at the Sphinx,â\\x80\\x9d I urged. â\\x80\\x9cEven I can feel the mystery and\\r\\nthe charm it exhales.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot looked at it discontentedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt has not the air happy,â\\x80\\x9d he declared. â\\x80\\x9cHow could it, half-buried\\r\\nin sand in that untidy fashion. Ah, this cursed sand!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, now, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of sand in Belgium,â\\x80\\x9d I reminded him,\\r\\nmindful of a holiday spent at Knocke-sur-mer in the midst of â\\x80\\x9c_les\\r\\ndunes impeccables_â\\x80\\x9d as the guide-book had phrased it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot in Brussels,â\\x80\\x9d declared Poirot. He gazed at the Pyramids\\r\\nthoughtfully. â\\x80\\x9cIt is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid\\r\\nand geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most\\r\\nunpleasing. And the palm-trees I like them not. Not even do they\\r\\nplant them in rows!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start\\r\\nfor the camp. We were to ride there on camels, and the beasts were\\r\\npatiently kneeling, waiting for us to mount, in charge of several\\r\\npicturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pass over the spectacle of Poirot on a camel. He started by\\r\\ngroans and lamentations and ended by shrieks, gesticulations and\\r\\ninvocations to the Virgin Mary and every Saint in the calendar. In\\r\\nthe end, he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a\\r\\ndiminutive donkey. I must admit that a trotting camel is no joke\\r\\nfor the amateur. I was stiff for several days.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we neared the scene of the excavations. A sunburnt man with\\r\\na grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet\\r\\nus.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We received your cable. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nsorry that there was no one to meet you in Cairo. An unforeseen\\r\\nevent occurred which completely disorganized our plans.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot paled. His hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush,\\r\\nstayed its course.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot another death?â\\x80\\x9d he breathed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir Guy Willard?â\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the cause?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTetanus.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI blanched. All around me I seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil,\\r\\nsubtle and menacing. A horrible thought flashed across me. Supposing\\r\\nI were the next?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon Dieu_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, in a very low voice, â\\x80\\x9cI do not understand\\r\\nthis. It is horrible. Tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it\\r\\nwas tetanus?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe not. But Dr. Ames will tell you more than I can do.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, of course, you are not the doctor.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy name is Tosswill.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, then, was the British expert described by Lady Willard as\\r\\nbeing a minor official at the British Museum. There was something\\r\\nat once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you will come with me,â\\x80\\x9d continued Dr. Tosswill, â\\x80\\x9cI will take\\r\\nyou to Sir Guy Willard. He was most anxious to be informed as soon\\r\\nas you should arrive.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were taken across the camp to a large tent. Dr. Tosswill lifted\\r\\nup the flap and we entered. Three men were sitting inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings have arrived, Sir Guy,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nTosswill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet\\r\\nus. There was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded\\r\\nme of his mother. He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and\\r\\nthat fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made\\r\\nhim look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring\\r\\nto bear up under a severe mental strain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man\\r\\nof thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and\\r\\nMr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the\\r\\nnational insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few minutesâ\\x80\\x99 desultory conversation the latter went out,\\r\\nand Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and\\r\\nDr. Ames.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlease ask any questions you want to ask, Monsieur Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nWillard. â\\x80\\x9cWe are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of\\r\\ndisasters, but it isnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94it canâ\\x80\\x99t be, anything but coincidence.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the\\r\\nwords. I saw that Poirot was studying him keenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour heart is really in this work, Sir Guy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRather. No matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is\\r\\ngoing on. Make up your mind to that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot wheeled round on the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have you to say to that, _monsieur le docteur_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d drawled the doctor, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not for quitting myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, _Ã©videmment_, we must find out just how we stand. When did\\r\\nMr. Schneiderâ\\x80\\x99s death take place?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThree days ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are sure it was tetanus?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDead sure.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for\\r\\ninstance?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Monsieur Poirot. I see what youâ\\x80\\x99re getting at. But it was a\\r\\nclear case of tetanus.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you not inject anti-serum?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly we did,â\\x80\\x9d said the doctor dryly. â\\x80\\x9cEvery conceivable thing\\r\\nthat could be done was tried.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad you the anti-serum with you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. We procured it from Cairo.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, not one.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you certain that the death of Mr. Bleibner was not due to\\r\\ntetanus?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which\\r\\nbecame poisoned, and septicÃ¦mia set in. It sounds pretty much the\\r\\nsame to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely\\r\\ndifferent.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen we have four deathsâ\\x80\\x94all totally dissimilar, one heart failure,\\r\\none blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly, Monsieur Poirot.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you certain that there is nothing which might link the four\\r\\ntogether?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t quite understand you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will put it plainly. Was any act committed by those four men\\r\\nwhich might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of Men-her-Ra?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor gazed at Poirot in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re talking through your hat, Monsieur Poirot. Surely youâ\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nnot been guyed into believing all that fool talk?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolute nonsense,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Willard angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his\\r\\ngreen catâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo you do not believe it, _monsieur le docteur_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, I do not,â\\x80\\x9d declared the doctor emphatically. â\\x80\\x9cI am a\\r\\nscientific man, and I believe only what science teaches.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas there no science then in Ancient Egypt?â\\x80\\x9d asked Poirot softly.\\r\\nHe did not wait for a reply, and indeed Dr. Ames seemed rather at\\r\\na loss for the moment. â\\x80\\x9cNo, no, do not answer me, but tell me this.\\r\\nWhat do the native workmen think?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI guess,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Ames, â\\x80\\x9cthat, where white folk lose their heads,\\r\\nnatives arenâ\\x80\\x99t going to be far behind. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll admit that theyâ\\x80\\x99re\\r\\ngetting what you might call scaredâ\\x80\\x94but theyâ\\x80\\x99ve no cause to be.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonder,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot non-committally.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Guy leant forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely,â\\x80\\x9d he cried incredulously, â\\x80\\x9cyou cannot believe inâ\\x80\\x94oh, but\\r\\nthe thingâ\\x80\\x99s absurd! You can know nothing of Ancient Egypt if you\\r\\nthink that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor answer Poirot produced a little book from his pocketâ\\x80\\x94an ancient\\r\\ntattered volume. As he held it out I saw its title, _The Magic of\\r\\nthe Egyptians and Chaldeans_. Then, wheeling round, he strode out\\r\\nof the tent. The doctor stared at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is his little idea?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase, so familiar on Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s lips, made me smile as it came\\r\\nfrom another.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know exactly,â\\x80\\x9d I confessed. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s got some plan of\\r\\nexorcizing the evil spirits, I believe.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI went in search of Poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced\\r\\nyoung man who had been the late Mr. Bleibnerâ\\x80\\x99s secretary.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Harper was saying, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve only been six months with the\\r\\nexpedition. Yes, I knew Mr. Bleibnerâ\\x80\\x99s affairs pretty well.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan you recount to me anything concerning his nephew?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. Iâ\\x80\\x99d never\\r\\nmet him before, but some of the others hadâ\\x80\\x94Ames, I think, and\\r\\nSchneider. The old man wasnâ\\x80\\x99t at all pleased to see him. They were\\r\\nat it in no time, hammer and tongs. â\\x80\\x98Not a cent,â\\x80\\x99 the old man\\r\\nshouted. â\\x80\\x98Not one cent now or when Iâ\\x80\\x99m dead. I intend to leave my\\r\\nmoney to the furtherance of my lifeâ\\x80\\x99s work. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been talking it\\r\\nover with Mr. Schneider to-day.â\\x80\\x99 And a bit more of the same. Young\\r\\nBleibner lit out for Cairo right away.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas he in perfectly good health at the time?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe old man?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, the young one.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. But\\r\\nit couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been anything serious, or I should have remembered.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne thing more, has Mr. Bleibner left a will?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo far as we know, he has not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you remaining with the expedition, Mr. Harper?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, I am not. Iâ\\x80\\x99m for New York as soon as I can square up\\r\\nthings here. You may laugh if you like, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to be\\r\\nthis blasted old Men-her-Raâ\\x80\\x99s next victim. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll get me if I stop\\r\\nhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man wiped the perspiration from his brow.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot turned away. Over his shoulder he said with a peculiar\\r\\nsmile:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRemember, he got one of his victims in New York.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, hell!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Harper forcibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat young man is nervous,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully. â\\x80\\x9cHe is on\\r\\nthe edge, but absolutely on the edge.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI glanced at Poirot curiously, but his enigmatical smile told me\\r\\nnothing. In company with Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill we were\\r\\ntaken round the excavations. The principal finds had been removed\\r\\nto Cairo, but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting.\\r\\nThe enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious, but I fancied that\\r\\nI detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could\\r\\nnot quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air. As we\\r\\nentered the tent which had been assigned to us, for a wash before\\r\\njoining the evening meal, a tall dark figure in white robes stood\\r\\naside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting\\r\\nin Arabic. Poirot stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are Hassan, the late Sir John Willardâ\\x80\\x99s servant?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI served my Lord Sir John, now I serve his son.â\\x80\\x9d He took a step\\r\\nnearer to us and lowered his voice. â\\x80\\x9cYou are a wise one, they say,\\r\\nlearned in dealing with evil spirits. Let the young master depart\\r\\nfrom here. There is evil in the air around us.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with an abrupt gesture, not waiting for a reply, he strode\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEvil in the air,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cYes, I feel it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOur meal was hardly a cheerful one. The floor was left to Dr.\\r\\nTosswill, who discoursed at length upon Egyptian antiquities. Just\\r\\nas we were preparing to retire to rest, Sir Guy caught Poirot by\\r\\nthe arm and pointed. A shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents.\\r\\nIt was no human one: I recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure\\r\\nI had seen carved on the walls of the tomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy blood literally froze at the sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon Dieu!_â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot, crossing himself vigorously. â\\x80\\x9cAnubis,\\r\\nthe jackal-headed, the god of departing souls.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSome one is hoaxing us,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dr. Tosswill, rising indignantly\\r\\nto his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt went into your tent, Harper,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Sir Guy, his face\\r\\ndreadfully pale.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, shaking his head, â\\x80\\x9cinto that of the Dr. Ames.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor stared at him incredulously; then, repeating Dr.\\r\\nTosswillâ\\x80\\x99s words, he cried:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSome one is hoaxing us. Come, weâ\\x80\\x99ll soon catch the fellow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition. I\\r\\nfollowed him, but, search as we would, we could find no trace of\\r\\nany living soul having passed that way. We returned, somewhat\\r\\ndisturbed in mind, to find Poirot taking energetic measures, in\\r\\nhis own way, to ensure his personal safety. He was busily\\r\\nsurrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which\\r\\nhe was drawing in the sand. I recognized the five-pointed star or\\r\\nPentagon many times repeated. As was his wont, Poirot was at the\\r\\nsame time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic\\r\\nin general, White Magic as opposed to Black, with various references\\r\\nto the Ka and the Book of the Dead thrown in.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in Dr. Tosswill, who\\r\\ndrew me aside, literally snorting with rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBalderdash, sir,â\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed angrily. â\\x80\\x9cPure balderdash. The\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s an impostor. He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know the difference between the\\r\\nsuperstitions of the Middle Ages and the beliefs of Ancient Egypt.\\r\\nNever have I heard such a hotch-potch of ignorance and credulity.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI calmed the excited expert, and joined Poirot in the tent. My\\r\\nlittle friend was beaming cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe can now sleep in peace,â\\x80\\x9d he declared happily. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I can do\\r\\nwith some sleep. My head, it aches abominably. Ah, for a good\\r\\n_tisane_!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs though in answer to prayer, the flap of the tent was lifted and\\r\\nHassan appeared, bearing a steaming cup which he offered to Poirot.\\r\\nIt proved to be camomile tea, a beverage of which he is inordinately\\r\\nfond. Having thanked Hassan and refused his offer of another cup\\r\\nfor myself, we were left alone once more. I stood at the door of\\r\\nthe tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA wonderful place,â\\x80\\x9d I said aloud, â\\x80\\x9cand a wonderful work. I can\\r\\nfeel the fascination. This desert life, this probing into the heart\\r\\nof a vanished civilization. Surely, Poirot, you, too, must feel\\r\\nthe charm?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI got no answer, and I turned, a little annoyed. My annoyance was\\r\\nquickly changed to concern. Poirot was lying back across the rude\\r\\ncouch, his face horribly convulsed. Beside him was the empty cup.\\r\\nI rushed to his side, then dashed out and across the camp to Dr.\\r\\nAmesâ\\x80\\x99s tent.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDr. Ames!â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cCome at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x9d said the doctor, appearing in pyjamas.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy friend. Heâ\\x80\\x99s ill. Dying. The camomile tea. Donâ\\x80\\x99t let Hassan\\r\\nleave the camp.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a flash the doctor ran to our tent. Poirot was lying as I left\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExtraordinary,â\\x80\\x9d cried Ames. â\\x80\\x9cLooks like a seizureâ\\x80\\x94orâ\\x80\\x94what did you\\r\\nsay about something he drank?â\\x80\\x9d He picked up the empty cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly I did not drink it!â\\x80\\x9d said a placid voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe turned in amazement. Poirot was sitting up on the bed. He was\\r\\nsmiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d he said gently. â\\x80\\x9cI did not drink it. While my good friend\\r\\nHastings was apostrophizing the night, I took the opportunity of\\r\\npouring it, not down my throat, but into a little bottle. That\\r\\nlittle bottle will go to the analytical chemist. Noâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94as the doctor\\r\\nmade a sudden movementâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cas a sensible man, you will understand that\\r\\nviolence will be of no avail. During Hastingsâ\\x80\\x99 brief absence to\\r\\nfetch you, I have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping. Ah,\\r\\nquick, Hastings, hold him!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI misunderstood Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s anxiety. Eager to save my friend, I flung\\r\\nmyself in front of him. But the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s swift movement had another\\r\\nmeaning. His hand went to his mouth, a smell of bitter almonds\\r\\nfilled the air, and he swayed forward and fell.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnother victim,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot gravely, â\\x80\\x9cbut the last. Perhaps it\\r\\nis the best way. He has three deaths on his head.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDr. Ames?â\\x80\\x9d I cried, stupefied. â\\x80\\x9cBut I thought you believed in some\\r\\noccult influence?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou misunderstood me, Hastings. What I meant was that I believe\\r\\nin the terrific force of superstition. Once get it firmly\\r\\nestablished that a series of deaths are supernatural, and you might\\r\\nalmost stab a man in broad daylight, and it would still be put down\\r\\nto the curse, so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural\\r\\nimplanted in the human race. I suspected from the first that a man\\r\\nwas taking advantage of that instinct. The idea came to him, I\\r\\nimagine, with the death of Sir John Willard. A fury of superstition\\r\\narose at once. As far as I could see, nobody could derive any\\r\\nparticular profit from Sir Johnâ\\x80\\x99s death. Mr. Bleibner was a\\r\\ndifferent case. He was a man of great wealth. The information I\\r\\nreceived from New York contained several suggestive points. To\\r\\nbegin with, young Bleibner was reported to have said he had a good\\r\\nfriend in Egypt from whom he could borrow. It was tacitly understood\\r\\nthat he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he\\r\\nwould have said so outright. The words suggest some boon companion\\r\\nof his own. Another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him\\r\\nto Egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet\\r\\nhe was able to pay the return passage to New York. Some one must\\r\\nhave lent him the money.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll that was very thin,â\\x80\\x9d I objected.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut there was more. Hastings, there occur often enough words\\r\\nspoken metaphorically which are taken literally. The opposite can\\r\\nhappen too. In this case, words which were meant literally were\\r\\ntaken metaphorically. Young Bleibner wrote plainly enough: â\\x80\\x98I am\\r\\na leper,â\\x80\\x99 but nobody realized that he shot himself because he\\r\\nbelieved that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. Young Bleibner\\r\\nwas suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the\\r\\nSouth Sea Islands, where the disease is common enough. Ames was a\\r\\nformer friend of his, and a well-known medical man, he would never\\r\\ndream of doubting his word. When I arrived here, my suspicions were\\r\\ndivided between Harper and Dr. Ames, but I soon realized that only\\r\\nthe doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes, and I\\r\\nlearnt from Harper that he was previously acquainted with young\\r\\nBleibner. Doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a\\r\\nwill or had insured his life in favour of the doctor. The latter\\r\\nsaw his chance of acquiring wealth. It was easy for him to inoculate\\r\\nMr. Bleibner with the deadly germs. Then the nephew, overcome with\\r\\ndespair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him, shot\\r\\nhimself. Mr. Bleibner, whatever his intentions, had made no will.\\r\\nHis fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Mr. Schneider?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe cannot be sure. He knew young Bleibner too, remember, and may\\r\\nhave suspected something, or, again, the doctor may have thought\\r\\nthat a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen\\r\\nthe coils of superstition. Furthermore, I will tell you an\\r\\ninteresting psychological fact, Hastings. A murderer has always a\\r\\nstrong desire to repeat his successful crime, the performance of\\r\\nit grows upon him. Hence my fears for young Willard. The figure of\\r\\nAnubis you saw to-night was Hassan, dressed up by my orders. I\\r\\nwanted to see if I could frighten the doctor. But it would take\\r\\nmore than the supernatural to frighten him. I could see that he\\r\\nwas not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult.\\r\\nThe little comedy I played for him did not deceive him. I suspected\\r\\nthat he would endeavour to make me the next victim. Ah, but in\\r\\nspite of _la mer maudite_, the heat abominable, and the annoyances\\r\\nof the sand, the little grey cells still functioned!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises. Young Bleibner,\\r\\nsome years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular\\r\\nwill, leaving â\\x80\\x9cmy cigarette case you admire so much and everything\\r\\nelse of which I die possessed which will be principally debts to\\r\\nmy good friend Robert Ames who once saved my life from drowning.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people\\r\\ntalk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the Tomb\\r\\nof Men-her-Ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone\\r\\nking upon the desecrators of his tombâ\\x80\\x94a belief which, as Poirot\\r\\npointed out to me, is contrary to all Egyptian belief and thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  VII\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Jewel Robbery at the _Grand Metropolitan_\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9ca change of air would do you good.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think so, _mon ami_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am sure of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEhâ\\x80\\x94eh?â\\x80\\x9d said my friend, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cIt is all arranged, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will come?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere do you propose to take me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBrighton. As a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the City put\\r\\nme on to a very good thing, andâ\\x80\\x94well, I have money to burn, as the\\r\\nsaying goes. I think a week-end at the _Grand Metropolitan_ would\\r\\ndo us all the good in the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, I accept most gratefully. You have the good heart to\\r\\nthink of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth\\r\\nall the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I who speak to you am in\\r\\ndanger of forgetting that sometimes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not quite relish the implication. I fancy that Poirot is\\r\\nsometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities.\\r\\nBut his pleasure was so evident that I put my slight annoyance\\r\\naside.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all right,â\\x80\\x9d I said hastily.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaturday evening saw us dining at the _Grand Metropolitan_ in the\\r\\nmidst of a gay throng. All the world and his wife seemed to be at\\r\\nBrighton. The dresses were marvellous, and the jewelsâ\\x80\\x94worn sometimes\\r\\nwith more love of display than good tasteâ\\x80\\x94were something magnificent.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Hein_, it is a sight this!â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cThis is the home\\r\\nof the Profiteer, is it not so, Hastings?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSupposed to be,â\\x80\\x9d I replied. â\\x80\\x9cBut weâ\\x80\\x99ll hope they arenâ\\x80\\x99t all tarred\\r\\nwith the Profiteering brush.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot gazed round him placidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my brains\\r\\nto crime, instead of to its detection. What a magnificent\\r\\nopportunity for some thief of distinction! Regard, Hastings, that\\r\\nstout woman by the pillar. She is, as you would say, plastered with\\r\\ngems.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI followed his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy,â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s Mrs. Opalsen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSlightly. Her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in\\r\\nthe recent Oil boom.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner we ran across the Opalsens in the lounge, and I\\r\\nintroduced Poirot to them. We chatted for a few minutes, and ended\\r\\nby having our coffee together.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems\\r\\ndisplayed on the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s ample bosom, and she brightened up at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a perfect hobby of mine, Mr. Poirot. I just _love_ jewellery.\\r\\nEd knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me\\r\\nsomething new. You are interested in precious stones?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have had a good deal to do with them one time and another,\\r\\nmadame. My profession has brought me into contact with some of the\\r\\nmost famous jewels in the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the\\r\\nhistoric jewels of a reigning house, and Mrs. Opalsen listened with\\r\\nbated breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere now!â\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, as he ended. â\\x80\\x9cIf it isnâ\\x80\\x99t just like a\\r\\nplay! You know, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got some pearls of my own that have a history\\r\\nattached to them. I believe itâ\\x80\\x99s supposed to be one of the finest\\r\\nnecklaces in the worldâ\\x80\\x94the pearls are so beautifully matched and\\r\\nso perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, madame,â\\x80\\x9d protested Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cyou are too amiable. Pray do not\\r\\nderange yourself!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to show it to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her\\r\\nhusband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMadame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her\\r\\npearl necklace,â\\x80\\x9d explained the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, the pearls!â\\x80\\x9d Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion. â\\x80\\x9cWell,\\r\\nthey _are_ worth seeing. Cost a pretty penny too! Still, the\\r\\nmoneyâ\\x80\\x99s there all right; I could get what I paid for them any\\r\\ndayâ\\x80\\x94perhaps more. May have to, too, if things go on as they are\\r\\nnow. Moneyâ\\x80\\x99s confoundedly tight in the City. All this infernal\\r\\nE.P.D.â\\x80\\x9d He rambled on, launching into technicalities where I could\\r\\nnot follow him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted by a small page-boy who approached and murmured\\r\\nsomething in his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEhâ\\x80\\x94what? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come at once. Not taken ill, is she? Excuse me,\\r\\ngentlemen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe left us abruptly. Poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny\\r\\nRussian cigarettes. Then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged\\r\\nthe empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the\\r\\nresult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minutes passed. The Opalsens did not return.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCurious,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked, at length. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder when they will come\\r\\nback.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said\\r\\nthoughtfully:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey will not come back.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause, my friend, something has happened.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of thing? How do you know?â\\x80\\x9d I asked curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office\\r\\nand ran upstairs. He was much agitated. The lift-boy is deep in\\r\\ntalk with one of the pages. The lift-bell has rung three times,\\r\\nbut he heeds it not. Thirdly, even the waiters are _distrait_; and\\r\\nto make a waiter _distrait_â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Poirot shook his head with an air\\r\\nof finality. â\\x80\\x9cThe affair must indeed be of the first magnitude.\\r\\nAh, it is as I thought! Here come the police.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men had just entered the hotelâ\\x80\\x94one in uniform, the other in\\r\\nplain clothes. They spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered\\r\\nupstairs. A few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up\\r\\nto where we were sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Opalsenâ\\x80\\x99s compliments, and would you step upstairs.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot sprang nimbly to his feet. One would have said that he\\r\\nawaited the summons. I followed with no less alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Opalsensâ\\x80\\x99 apartments were situated on the first floor. After\\r\\nknocking on the door, the page-boy retired, and we answered the\\r\\nsummons, â\\x80\\x9cCome in!â\\x80\\x9d A strange scene met our eyes. The room was Mrs.\\r\\nOpalsenâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom, and in the centre of it, lying back in an\\r\\narm-chair, was the lady herself, weeping violently. She presented\\r\\nan extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in\\r\\nthe powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. Mr.\\r\\nOpalsen was striding up and down angrily. The two police officials\\r\\nstood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. An\\r\\nhotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the\\r\\nfire-place; and on the other side of the room a Frenchwoman,\\r\\nobviously Mrs. Opalsenâ\\x80\\x99s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands,\\r\\nwith an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto this pandemonium stepped Poirot, neat and smiling. Immediately,\\r\\nwith an energy surprising in one of her bulk, Mrs. Opalsen sprang\\r\\nfrom her chair towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere now; Ed may say what he likes, but I believe in luck, I do.\\r\\nIt was fated I should meet you the way I did this evening, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\na feeling that if you canâ\\x80\\x99t get my pearls back for me nobody can.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCalm yourself, I pray of you, madame.â\\x80\\x9d Poirot patted her hand\\r\\nsoothingly. â\\x80\\x9cReassure yourself. All will be well. Hercule Poirot\\r\\nwill aid you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Opalsen turned to the police inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere will be no objection to myâ\\x80\\x94erâ\\x80\\x94calling in this gentleman, I\\r\\nsuppose?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone at all, sir,â\\x80\\x9d replied the man civilly, but with complete\\r\\nindifference. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps now your ladyâ\\x80\\x99s feeling better sheâ\\x80\\x99ll just\\r\\nlet us have the facts?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Opalsen looked helplessly at Poirot. He led her back to her\\r\\nchair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without\\r\\nagitating yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThus abjured, Mrs. Opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot\\r\\nhere to see. The chambermaid and CÃ©lestine were both in the room\\r\\nas usualâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, madame, but what do you mean by â\\x80\\x98as usualâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Opalsen explained.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless\\r\\nCÃ©lestine, the maid, is there also. The chambermaid does the room\\r\\nin the morning while CÃ©lestine is present, and comes in after\\r\\ndinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise\\r\\nshe never enters the room.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, as I was saying,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Opalsen, â\\x80\\x9cI came up. I went\\r\\nto the drawer here,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of\\r\\nthe knee-hole dressing-tableâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ctook out my jewel-case and unlocked\\r\\nit. It seemed quite as usualâ\\x80\\x94but the pearls were not there!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inspector had been busy with his notebook. â\\x80\\x9cWhen had you last\\r\\nseen them?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey were there when I went down to dinner.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are sure?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in\\r\\nthe end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the\\r\\njewel-case.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho locked up the jewel-case?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did. I wear the key on a chain round my neck.â\\x80\\x9d She held it up\\r\\nas she spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The\\r\\nlock is quite a simple one. What did you do after youâ\\x80\\x99d locked the\\r\\njewel-case?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI put it back in the bottom drawer where I always keep it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou didnâ\\x80\\x99t lock the drawer?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I never do. My maid remains in the room till I come up, so\\r\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s no need.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inspectorâ\\x80\\x99s face grew graver.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAm I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down\\r\\nto dinner, and that since then _the maid has not left the room_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first\\r\\ntime burst upon her, CÃ©lestine uttered a piercing shriek, and,\\r\\nflinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent\\r\\nFrench.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suggestion was infamous! That she should be suspected of\\r\\nrobbing Madame! The police were well known to be of a stupidity\\r\\nincredible! But Monsieur, who was a Frenchmanâ\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA Belgian,â\\x80\\x9d interjected Poirot, but CÃ©lestine paid no attention\\r\\nto the correction.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused, while that\\r\\ninfamous chambermaid was allowed to go scot-free. She had never\\r\\nliked herâ\\x80\\x94a bold, red-faced thingâ\\x80\\x94a born thief. She had said from\\r\\nthe first that she was not honest. And had kept a sharp watch over\\r\\nher too, when she was doing Madameâ\\x80\\x99s room! Let those idiots of\\r\\npolicemen search her, and if they did not find Madameâ\\x80\\x99s pearls on\\r\\nher it would be very surprising!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French,\\r\\nCÃ©lestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the\\r\\nchambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened\\r\\nangrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf that foreign womanâ\\x80\\x99s saying I took the pearls, itâ\\x80\\x99s a lie!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe declared heatedly. â\\x80\\x9cI never so much as saw them.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSearch her!â\\x80\\x9d screamed the other. â\\x80\\x9cYou will find it is as I say.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re a liarâ\\x80\\x94do you hear?â\\x80\\x9d said the chambermaid, advancing upon\\r\\nher. â\\x80\\x9cStole â\\x80\\x99em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only\\r\\nin the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then\\r\\nyou were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat\\r\\nwatching a mouse.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inspector looked across inquiringly at CÃ©lestine. â\\x80\\x9cIs that\\r\\ntrue? Didnâ\\x80\\x99t you leave the room at all?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not actually leave her alone,â\\x80\\x9d admitted CÃ©lestine reluctantly,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut I went into my own room through the door here twiceâ\\x80\\x94once to\\r\\nfetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have\\r\\ndone it then.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wasnâ\\x80\\x99t gone a minute,â\\x80\\x9d retorted the chambermaid angrily. â\\x80\\x9cJust\\r\\npopped out and in again. Iâ\\x80\\x99d be glad if the police _would_ search\\r\\nme. _Iâ\\x80\\x99ve nothing to be afraid of_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment there was a tap at the door. The inspector went to\\r\\nit. His face brightened when he saw who it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s rather fortunate. I sent for one of our\\r\\nfemale searchers, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s just arrived. Perhaps if you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nmind going into the room next door.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at the chambermaid, who stepped across the threshold with\\r\\na toss of her head, the searcher following her closely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French girl had sunk sobbing into a chair. Poirot was looking\\r\\nround the room, the main features of which I have made clear by a\\r\\nsketch.\\r\\n\\r\\n[A sketch of the bedroom, adjoining maid\\'s room, and corridor.]\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere does that door lead?â\\x80\\x9d he inquired, nodding his head towards\\r\\nthe one by the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cInto the next apartment, I believe,â\\x80\\x9d said the inspector. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbolted, anyway, on this side.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot walked across to it, tried it, then drew back the bolt and\\r\\ntried it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd on the other side as well,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked. â\\x80\\x9cWell, that seems to\\r\\nrule out that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked over to the windows, examining each of them in turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd againâ\\x80\\x94nothing. Not even a balcony outside.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEven if there were,â\\x80\\x9d said the inspector impatiently, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see\\r\\nhow that would help us, if the maid never left the room.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Ã\\x89videmment_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, not disconcerted. â\\x80\\x9cAs Mademoiselle is\\r\\npositive she did not leave the roomâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the\\r\\npolice searcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing,â\\x80\\x9d said the latter laconically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should hope not, indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said the chambermaid virtuously. â\\x80\\x9cAnd\\r\\nthat French hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an\\r\\nhonest girlâ\\x80\\x99s character!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, there, my girl; thatâ\\x80\\x99s all right,â\\x80\\x9d said the inspector,\\r\\nopening the door. â\\x80\\x9cNobody suspects you. You go along and get on\\r\\nwith your work.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chambermaid went unwillingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoing to search _her_?â\\x80\\x9d she demanded, pointing at CÃ©lestine.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes!â\\x80\\x9d He shut the door on her and turned the key.\\r\\n\\r\\nCÃ©lestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn.\\r\\nA few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inspectorâ\\x80\\x99s face grew graver.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to ask you to come along with me all the\\r\\nsame, miss.â\\x80\\x9d He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, madam, but all\\r\\nthe evidence points that way. If sheâ\\x80\\x99s not got them on her, theyâ\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nhidden somewhere about the room.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCÃ©lestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s arm.\\r\\nThe latter bent and whispered something in the girlâ\\x80\\x99s ear. She\\r\\nlooked up at him doubtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Si, si, mon enfant_â\\x80\\x94I assure you it is better not to resist.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThen he turned to the inspector. â\\x80\\x9cYou permit, monsieur? A little\\r\\nexperimentâ\\x80\\x94purely for my own satisfaction.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDepends on what it is,â\\x80\\x9d replied the police officer non-committally.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot addressed CÃ©lestine once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of\\r\\ncotton. Whereabouts was it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the scissors?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey also.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to\\r\\nrepeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work,\\r\\nyou say?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCÃ©lestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed\\r\\ninto the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of\\r\\ndrawers, and returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot divided his attention between her movements and a large\\r\\nturnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAgain, if you please, mademoiselle.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his\\r\\npocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he bowed to the\\r\\ninspectorâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cfor your courtesy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive\\r\\npoliteness. CÃ©lestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by\\r\\nthe woman and the plain-clothes official.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, with a brief apology to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector set to\\r\\nwork to ransack the room. He pulled out drawers, opened cupboards,\\r\\ncompletely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. Mr. Opalsen looked\\r\\non sceptically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou really think you will find them?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. It stands to reason. She hadnâ\\x80\\x99t time to take them out\\r\\nof the room. The ladyâ\\x80\\x99s discovering the robbery so soon upset her\\r\\nplans. No, theyâ\\x80\\x99re here right enough. One of the two must have\\r\\nhidden themâ\\x80\\x94and itâ\\x80\\x99s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done\\r\\nso.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMore than unlikelyâ\\x80\\x94impossible!â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh?â\\x80\\x9d The inspector stared.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot smiled modestly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in\\r\\nyour handâ\\x80\\x94with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed\\r\\nMademoiselleâ\\x80\\x99s movementsâ\\x80\\x94her first absence from the room was of\\r\\ntwelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions.\\r\\nMadame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case.\\r\\nI thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Go!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo!â\\x80\\x9d I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer\\r\\nof the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in\\r\\nthe lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and\\r\\nlocked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to\\r\\nagain. His movements were like lightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, _mon ami_?â\\x80\\x9d he demanded of me breathlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cForty-six seconds,â\\x80\\x9d I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see?â\\x80\\x9d He looked round. â\\x80\\x9cThere would not have been time for\\r\\nthe chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen that settles it on the maid,â\\x80\\x9d said the inspector with\\r\\nsatisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maidâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbedroom next door.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at\\r\\nMr. Opalsen.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis necklaceâ\\x80\\x94it was, without doubt, insured?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d he said hesitatingly, â\\x80\\x9cthat is so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what does that matter?â\\x80\\x9d broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmy necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI comprehend, madame,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot soothingly. â\\x80\\x9cI comprehend\\r\\nperfectly. To _la femme_ sentiment is everythingâ\\x80\\x94is it not so? But\\r\\nmonsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless\\r\\nfind some slight consolation in the fact.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStillâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He\\r\\ncame in dangling something from his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was\\r\\na changed woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, oh, my necklace!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere was it?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Opalsen.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaidâ\\x80\\x99s bed. In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must\\r\\nhave stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived\\r\\non the scene.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou permit, madame?â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from\\r\\nher and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid, madam, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to hand it over to us for the time\\r\\nbeing,â\\x80\\x9d said the inspector. â\\x80\\x9cWe shall want it for the charge. But\\r\\nit shall be returned to you as soon as possible.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Opalsen frowned.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that necessary?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid so, sir. Just a formality.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, let him take it, Ed!â\\x80\\x9d cried his wife. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d feel safer if he\\r\\ndid. I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and\\r\\nget hold of it. That wretched girl! And I would never have believed\\r\\nit of her.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, there, my dear, donâ\\x80\\x99t take on so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt a gentle pressure on my arm. It was Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall we slip away, my friend? I think our services are no longer\\r\\nneeded.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise,\\r\\nhe remarked:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should rather like to see the room next door.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door was not locked, and we entered. The room, which was a\\r\\nlarge double one, was unoccupied. Dust lay about rather noticeably,\\r\\nand my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran\\r\\nhis finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe _service_ leaves to be desired,â\\x80\\x9d he observed dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have\\r\\nfallen into a brown study.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d I demanded impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cWhat did we come in here for?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Je vous demande pardon, mon ami_. I wished to see if the door\\r\\nwas really bolted on this side also.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d I said, glancing at the door which communicated with the\\r\\nroom we had just left, â\\x80\\x9cit _is_ bolted.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot nodded. He still seemed to be thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd, anyway,â\\x80\\x9d I continued, â\\x80\\x9cwhat does it matter? The case is over.\\r\\nI wish youâ\\x80\\x99d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it\\r\\nwas the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that\\r\\ninspector couldnâ\\x80\\x99t go wrong over.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find\\r\\nout who stole the pearls.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the maid did!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy do you say that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy,â\\x80\\x9d I stammered, â\\x80\\x9cthey were foundâ\\x80\\x94actually in her mattress.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTa, ta, ta!â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cThose were not the pearls.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImitation, _mon ami_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently\\r\\nthere will be a fine hullabaloo!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome!â\\x80\\x9d I cried, dragging at his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe must tell the Opalsens at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut that poor womanâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien_; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much\\r\\nbetter night believing the jewels to be safe.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the thief may escape with them!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know\\r\\nthat the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were\\r\\nnot the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place\\r\\nat a much earlier date?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d I said, bewildered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, beaming. â\\x80\\x9cWe start again.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though\\r\\nconsidering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor,\\r\\nstopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets\\r\\nof the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid\\r\\nappeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing\\r\\nher late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in\\r\\nthe middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will\\r\\nunlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsenâ\\x80\\x99s room.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage\\r\\nagain. Mr. Opalsenâ\\x80\\x99s room was on the other side of the corridor,\\r\\nits door facing that of his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s room. The chambermaid unlocked\\r\\nit with her pass-key, and we entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she was about to depart Poirot detained her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne moment; have you ever seen among the effects of Mr. Opalsen\\r\\na card like this?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon\\r\\nin appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, I canâ\\x80\\x99t say I have. But, anyway, the valet has most to\\r\\ndo with the gentlemenâ\\x80\\x99s rooms.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see. Thank you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to\\r\\nreflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRing the bell, I pray of you, Hastings. Three times, for the\\r\\nvalet.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied\\r\\nthe waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through\\r\\nits contents.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put\\r\\nthe same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the\\r\\nresponse was the same. The valet had never seen a card of that\\r\\nparticular quality among Mr. Opalsenâ\\x80\\x99s belongings. Poirot thanked\\r\\nhim, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive\\r\\nglance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the\\r\\nfloor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s thoughtful\\r\\nremark as he bundled the torn papers back again:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the necklace was heavily insured. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I cried,  â\\x80\\x9cI seeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see nothing, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d he replied quickly. â\\x80\\x9cAs usual,\\r\\nnothing at all! It is incredibleâ\\x80\\x94but there it is. Let us return to\\r\\nour own apartments.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did so in silence. Once there, to my intense surprise, Poirot\\r\\neffected a rapid change of clothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI go to London to-night,â\\x80\\x9d he explained. â\\x80\\x9cIt is imperative.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave\\r\\nlittle grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I\\r\\nshall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll come a cropper one of these days,â\\x80\\x9d I observed, rather\\r\\ndisgusted by his vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not be enraged, I beg of you, _mon ami_. I count on you to do\\r\\nme a serviceâ\\x80\\x94of your friendship.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course,â\\x80\\x9d I said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness. â\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\nis it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe sleeve of my coat that I have taken offâ\\x80\\x94will you brush it?\\r\\nSee you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt\\r\\nobserved me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the\\r\\npowder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it\\r\\non my sleeve; an action without method which I deploreâ\\x80\\x94false to\\r\\nall my principles.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what was the powder?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, not particularly interested in\\r\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot the poison of the Borgias,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot, with a twinkle.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French\\r\\nchalk.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrench chalk?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou old sinner! I thought you were working up to something\\r\\nexciting.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAu revoir, my friend. I save myself. I fly!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of\\r\\naffection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the\\r\\nclothes-brush.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a\\r\\nstroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel.\\r\\nIn the afternoon we went for a spin. A punctured tyre delayed us,\\r\\nand it was past eight when I got back to the _Grand Metropolitan_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first sight that met my eyes was Poirot, looking even more\\r\\ndiminutive than usual, sandwiched between the Opalsens, beaming in\\r\\na state of placid satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon ami_ Hastings!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, and sprang to meet me. â\\x80\\x9cEmbrace\\r\\nme, my friend; all has marched to a marvel!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily, the embrace was merely figurativeâ\\x80\\x94not a thing one is\\r\\nalways sure of with Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you meanâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d I began.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust wonderful, I call it!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Opalsen, smiling all over\\r\\nher fat face. â\\x80\\x9cDidnâ\\x80\\x99t I tell you, Ed, that if he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get back\\r\\nmy pearls nobody would?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did, my dear, you did. And you were right.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside.\\r\\nSeat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has\\r\\nso happily ended.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEnded?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut yes. They are arrested.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho are arrested?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe chambermaid and the valet, _parbleu_! You did not suspect?\\r\\nNot with my parting hint about the French chalk?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou said cabinet-makers used it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly they doâ\\x80\\x94to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted\\r\\nthat drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that\\r\\nbe? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that\\r\\nit did not at once leap to the eyeâ\\x80\\x94not even to the eye of Hercule\\r\\nPoirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room\\r\\nnext door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a\\r\\nflash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the\\r\\njewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the\\r\\ndoor. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with\\r\\nwhich he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits\\r\\nhis time. CÃ©lestine leaves the room again, andâ\\x80\\x94pst!â\\x80\\x94in a flash the\\r\\ncase is passed back again and replaced in the drawer.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMadame arrives, the theft is discovered. The chambermaid demands\\r\\nto be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and\\r\\nleaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation\\r\\nnecklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed\\r\\nin the French girlâ\\x80\\x99s bed that morning by the chambermaidâ\\x80\\x94a master\\r\\nstroke, _Ã§a!_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what did you go to London for?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou remember the card?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. It puzzled meâ\\x80\\x94and puzzles me still. I thoughtâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot laughed heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Une blague!_ For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with\\r\\na specially prepared surfaceâ\\x80\\x94for finger-prints. I went straight\\r\\nto Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid\\r\\nthe facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved\\r\\nto be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been â\\x80\\x98wantedâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nfor some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested,\\r\\nand the necklace was discovered in the valetâ\\x80\\x99s possession. A clever\\r\\npair, but they failed in _method_. Have I not told you, Hastings,\\r\\nat least thirty-six times, that without methodâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt least thirty-six thousand times!â\\x80\\x9d I interrupted. â\\x80\\x9cBut where\\r\\ndid their â\\x80\\x98methodâ\\x80\\x99 break down?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon ami_, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or\\r\\nvaletâ\\x80\\x94but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room\\r\\nundusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on\\r\\nthe little table near the communicating door, it left a square\\r\\nmarkâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI remember,â\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBefore, I was undecided. Thenâ\\x80\\x94I _knew_!â\\x80\\x9d There was a momentâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsilence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got my pearls,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek\\r\\nchorus.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d better have some dinner.â\\x80\\x9d Poirot accompanied\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis ought to mean kudos for you,â\\x80\\x9d I observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Pas du tout_,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot tranquilly. â\\x80\\x9cJapp and the local\\r\\ninspector will divide the credit between them. Butâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he tapped his\\r\\npocketâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cI have a cheque here, from Mr. Opalsen, and, how say you,\\r\\nmy friend? This week-end has not gone according to plan. Shall we\\r\\nreturn here next week-endâ\\x80\\x94at my expense this time?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  VIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Kidnapped Prime Minister\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that war and the problems of war are things of the past, I\\r\\nthink I may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which\\r\\nmy friend Poirot played in a moment of national crisis. The secret\\r\\nhas been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But,\\r\\nnow that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just\\r\\nthat England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little\\r\\nfriend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening after dinnerâ\\x80\\x94I will not particularize the date; it\\r\\nsuffices to say that it was at the time when â\\x80\\x9cPeace by negotiationâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nwas the parrot-cry of Englandâ\\x80\\x99s enemiesâ\\x80\\x94my friend and I were\\r\\nsitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had\\r\\nbeen given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop\\r\\nin on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any\\r\\ncases of interest that he might have on hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that\\r\\ndayâ\\x80\\x94no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam,\\r\\nEnglandâ\\x80\\x99s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently\\r\\nbeen carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime\\r\\nMinister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his\\r\\ncheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nI considered that our police must have been shamefully careless\\r\\nfor such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that\\r\\nthe German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such\\r\\nan achievement. â\\x80\\x9cFighting Mac,â\\x80\\x9d as his own party had nicknamed him,\\r\\nhad strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence\\r\\nwhich was becoming so prevalent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was more than Englandâ\\x80\\x99s Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x94he _was_ England; and\\r\\nto have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been\\r\\na crushing and paralysing blow to Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never\\r\\nwas there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were\\r\\nhis passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he\\r\\nwas quite unable to give me his full attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but\\r\\nfinished. The spot of greaseâ\\x80\\x94he is not goodâ\\x80\\x94I remove himâ\\x80\\x94so!â\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\nwaved his sponge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI smiled as I lit another cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnything interesting on?â\\x80\\x9d I inquired, after a minute or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assist aâ\\x80\\x94how do you call it?â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98charladyâ\\x80\\x99 to find her husband. A\\r\\ndifficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that\\r\\nwhen he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my\\r\\npart, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose\\r\\nhimself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt last! The spot of grease, he is gone! I am at your disposal.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate\\r\\nMacAdam?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Enfantillage!_â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot promptly. â\\x80\\x9cOne can hardly take it\\r\\nseriously. To fire with the rifleâ\\x80\\x94never does it succeed. It is a\\r\\ndevice of the past.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was very near succeeding this time,â\\x80\\x9d I reminded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the\\r\\nlandlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there\\r\\nwere two gentlemen below who wanted to see him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey wonâ\\x80\\x99t give their names, sir, but they says as itâ\\x80\\x99s very\\r\\nimportant.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet them mount,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart\\r\\ngave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage\\r\\nthan Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his\\r\\ncompanion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet,\\r\\nand, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend\\r\\nbowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. â\\x80\\x9cMy business is\\r\\nprivate.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may speak freely before Captain Hastings,â\\x80\\x9d said my friend,\\r\\nnodding to me to remain. â\\x80\\x9cHe has not all the gifts, no! But I\\r\\nanswer for his discretion.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come onâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t letâ\\x80\\x99s beat about the bush! As far as I can see,\\r\\nthe whole of England will know the hole weâ\\x80\\x99re in soon enough.\\r\\nTimeâ\\x80\\x99s everything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray be seated, messieurs,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot politely. â\\x80\\x9cWill you take\\r\\nthe big chair, _milord_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Estair started slightly. â\\x80\\x9cYou know me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot smiled. â\\x80\\x9cCertainly. I read the little papers with the\\r\\npictures. How should I not know you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the\\r\\nmost vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have the word of Hercule Poirotâ\\x80\\x94I can say no more!â\\x80\\x9d said my\\r\\nfriend grandiloquently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt concerns the Prime Minister. We are in grave trouble.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re up a tree!â\\x80\\x9d interposed Mr. Dodge.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe injury is serious, then?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat injury?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe bullet wound.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, that!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Dodge contemptuously. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s old history.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs my colleague says,â\\x80\\x9d continued Lord Estair, â\\x80\\x9cthat affair is over\\r\\nand done with. Luckily, it failed. I wished I could say as much\\r\\nfor the second attempt.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere has been a second attempt, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, though not of the same nature. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime\\r\\nMinister has disappeared.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has been kidnapped!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d I cried, stupefied.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot threw a withering glance at me, which I knew enjoined me to\\r\\nkeep my mouth shut.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUnfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncontinued his lordship.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot looked at Mr. Dodge. â\\x80\\x9cYou said just now, monsieur, that time\\r\\nwas everything. What did you mean by that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men exchanged glances, and then Lord Estair said:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have heard, Monsieur Poirot, of the approaching Allied\\r\\nConference?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where\\r\\nit is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the\\r\\nnewspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic\\r\\ncircles. The Conference is to be held to-morrowâ\\x80\\x94Thursdayâ\\x80\\x94evening\\r\\nat Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the\\r\\nsituation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npresence at the Conference is a vital necessity. The Pacifist\\r\\npropaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our\\r\\nmidst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the\\r\\nturning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of\\r\\nthe Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious\\r\\nresultsâ\\x80\\x94possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no\\r\\none who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s face had grown very grave. â\\x80\\x9cThen you regard the kidnapping\\r\\nof the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being\\r\\npresent at the Conference?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMost certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the\\r\\ntime.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the Conference is to be held?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock to-morrow night.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is now a quarter to nine.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwenty-four hours,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd a quarter,â\\x80\\x9d amended Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cDo not forget the quarter,\\r\\nmonsieurâ\\x80\\x94it may come in useful. Now for the detailsâ\\x80\\x94the abduction,\\r\\ndid it take place in England or in France?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to\\r\\nstay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding\\r\\nto-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer.\\r\\nAt Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one\\r\\nof the Commander-in-Chiefâ\\x80\\x99s A.D.C.s.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, they started from Boulogneâ\\x80\\x94but they never arrived.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real\\r\\ncar was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C.\\r\\nneatly gagged and bound.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the bogus car?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs still at large.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot made a gesture of impatience. â\\x80\\x9cIncredible! Surely it cannot\\r\\nescape attention for long?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly.\\r\\nThat part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that\\r\\nthe car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own\\r\\nScotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It\\r\\nis, as you say, incredibleâ\\x80\\x94but nothing has been discovered!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered\\r\\nwith a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you\\r\\ndirected.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The\\r\\nofficer withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They\\r\\nhave found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed,\\r\\ngagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near Câ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94. He remembers\\r\\nnothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose\\r\\nfrom behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are\\r\\nsatisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd they have found nothing else?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it\\r\\nis strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they\\r\\nnow taking so much trouble to keep him alive?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDodge shook his head. â\\x80\\x9cOne thingâ\\x80\\x99s quite certain. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re determined\\r\\nat all costs to prevent his attending the Conference.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God\\r\\ngrant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me\\r\\neverythingâ\\x80\\x94from the beginning. I must know about this shooting\\r\\naffair as well.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLast night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his\\r\\nsecretaries, Captain Danielsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe same who accompanied him to France?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the\\r\\nPrime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he\\r\\nreturned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted\\r\\nassassination took place.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have\\r\\nhis dossier?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Estair smiled. â\\x80\\x9cI thought you would ask me that. We do not\\r\\nknow very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served\\r\\nin the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an\\r\\nexceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages.\\r\\nIt is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany\\r\\nhim to France.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas he any relatives in England?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwo aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss\\r\\nDaniels, who lives near Ascot.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAscot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat point has not been overlooked. But it has led to nothing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estairâ\\x80\\x99s voice, as he replied:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I\\r\\npronounced _anyone_ above suspicion.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_TrÃ¨s bien_. Now I understand, _milord_, that the Prime Minister\\r\\nwould, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection,\\r\\nwhich ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Estair bowed his head. â\\x80\\x9cThat is so. The Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s car\\r\\nwas closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain\\r\\nclothes. Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is\\r\\npersonally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them\\r\\naway arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own\\r\\narrangements. In fact, the Premierâ\\x80\\x99s chauffeur, Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy, is a\\r\\nC.I.D. man.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOâ\\x80\\x99Murphy? That is a name of Ireland, is it not so?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he is an Irishman.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom what part of Ireland?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCounty Clare, I believe.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Tiens!_ But proceed, _milord_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and\\r\\nCaptain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual. But,\\r\\nunluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s car\\r\\ndeviated from the main roadâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt a point where the road curves?â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94but how did you know?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, _câ\\x80\\x99est Ã©vident_! Continue!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor some unknown reason,â\\x80\\x9d continued Lord Estair, â\\x80\\x9cthe Premierâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncar left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation,\\r\\ncontinued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the\\r\\nunfrequented lane, the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s car was suddenly held up\\r\\nby a band of masked men. The chauffeurâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat brave Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy!â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The\\r\\nPrime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot\\r\\nrang outâ\\x80\\x94then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second,\\r\\nfortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger,\\r\\ninstantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA near escape,â\\x80\\x9d I ejaculated, with a shiver.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had\\r\\nreceived. He declared it was only a scratch. He stopped at a local\\r\\ncottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound upâ\\x80\\x94he did not, of\\r\\ncourse, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule,\\r\\nstraight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was\\r\\nawaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had\\r\\nbeen given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly\\r\\ndeparted for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting\\r\\ndestroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for\\r\\nhim, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is all you have to tell me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, there is one rather peculiar thing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s car did not return home after leaving the\\r\\nPrime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to\\r\\ninterview Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car\\r\\nwas discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little\\r\\nrestaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of\\r\\nGerman agents.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the chauffeur?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe chauffeur was nowhere to be found. He, too, had disappeared.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully, â\\x80\\x9cthere are two disappearances: the\\r\\nPrime Minister in France, and Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy in London.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked keenly at Lord Estair, who made a gesture of despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested\\r\\nto me yesterday that Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed\\r\\nin his face.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd to-day?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo-day I do not know what to think.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot nodded gravely. He looked at his turnip of a watch again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand that I have carte blanche, messieursâ\\x80\\x94in every way,\\r\\nI mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hourâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ntime, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard. You shall be\\r\\naccompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold\\r\\nthemselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made\\r\\nyou come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of\\r\\nyours.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very\\r\\ngreat man of your own country.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Comment?_ My old friend the _PrÃ©fet_â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Estair shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne higher than the _PrÃ©fet_. One whose word was once law in\\r\\nBelgiumâ\\x80\\x94and shall be again! That England has sworn!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute. â\\x80\\x9cAmen to that!\\r\\nAh, but my Master does not forget. . . . Messieurs, I, Hercule\\r\\nPoirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will\\r\\nbe in time. But this is darkâ\\x80\\x94dark. . . . I cannot see.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d I cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the\\r\\nMinisters, â\\x80\\x9cwhat do you think?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft\\r\\nmovements. He shook his head thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not know what to think. My brains desert me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do\\r\\nas well?â\\x80\\x9d I mused.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon me, _mon ami_, but I did not quite say that. It is\\r\\nundoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause uncertainty creates panic. That is one reason. Were the\\r\\nPrime Minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the\\r\\nsituation would have to be faced. But now you have paralysis. Will\\r\\nthe Prime Minister reappear, or will he not? Is he dead or alive?\\r\\nNobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done.\\r\\nAnd, as I tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what _les\\r\\nBoches_ are playing for. Then, again, if the kidnappers are holding\\r\\nhim secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to\\r\\nmake terms with both sides. The German Government is not a liberal\\r\\npaymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge\\r\\nsubstantial remittances in such a case as this. Thirdly, they run\\r\\nno risk of the hangmanâ\\x80\\x99s rope. Oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their\\r\\naffair.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, if that is so, why should they first try to shoot him?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot made a gesture of anger. â\\x80\\x9cAh, that is just what I do not\\r\\nunderstand! It is inexplicableâ\\x80\\x94stupid! They have all their\\r\\narrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the\\r\\nabduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic\\r\\nattack, worthy of a Cinema, and quite as unreal. It is almost\\r\\nimpossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not\\r\\ntwenty miles from London!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened\\r\\nirrespective of each other,â\\x80\\x9d I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Then, furtherâ\\x80\\x94who\\r\\nis the traitor? There must have been a traitorâ\\x80\\x94in the first affair,\\r\\nanyway. But who was itâ\\x80\\x94Daniels or Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy? It must have been one\\r\\nof the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot\\r\\nsuppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination!\\r\\nDid Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels\\r\\nwho told him to do so?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely it must have been Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphyâ\\x80\\x99s doing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, because if it was Danielsâ\\x80\\x99 the Prime Minister would have\\r\\nheard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are\\r\\naltogether too many â\\x80\\x98whysâ\\x80\\x99 in this affair, and they contradict each\\r\\nother. If Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy is an honest man, _why_ did he leave the main\\r\\nroad? But if he was a dishonest man, _why_ did he start the car\\r\\nagain when only two shots had been firedâ\\x80\\x94thereby, in all probability,\\r\\nsaving the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s life? And, again, if he was honest,\\r\\nwhy did he, immediately on leaving Charing Cross, drive to a\\r\\nwell-known rendezvous of German spies?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt looks bad,â\\x80\\x9d I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us look at the case with method. What have we for and against\\r\\nthese two men? Take Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy first. Against: that his conduct in\\r\\nleaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from\\r\\nCounty Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive\\r\\nmanner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the\\r\\nPremierâ\\x80\\x99s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously,\\r\\nfrom the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels.\\r\\nThere is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is\\r\\nknown of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages\\r\\nfor a good Englishman! (Pardon me, _mon ami_, but, as linguists,\\r\\nyou are deplorable!) _Now for him_, we have the fact that he was\\r\\nfound gagged, bound, and chloroformedâ\\x80\\x94which does not look as though\\r\\nhe had anything to do with the matter.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe might have gagged and bound himself, to divert suspicion.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot shook his head. â\\x80\\x9cThe French police would make no mistake of\\r\\nthat kind. Besides, once he had attained his object, and the Prime\\r\\nMinister was safely abducted, there would not be much point in his\\r\\nremaining behind. His accomplices _could_ have gagged and\\r\\nchloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see what object they\\r\\nhoped to accomplish by it. He can be of little use to them now,\\r\\nfor, until the circumstances concerning the Prime Minister have\\r\\nbeen cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen why did he not do so? He merely says that something was\\r\\npressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing\\r\\nmore. There is no false scent there. It sounds remarkably like the\\r\\ntruth.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d I said, glancing at the clock, â\\x80\\x9cI suppose weâ\\x80\\x99d better start\\r\\nfor the station. You may find more clues in France.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPossibly, _mon ami_, but I doubt it. It is still incredible to me\\r\\nthat the Prime Minister has not been discovered in that limited\\r\\narea, where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous.\\r\\nIf the military and the police of two countries have not found him,\\r\\nhow shall I?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Charing Cross we were met by Mr. Dodge.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is Detective Barnes, of Scotland Yard, and Major Norman. They\\r\\nwill hold themselves entirely at your disposal. Good luck to you.\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s a bad business, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve not given up hope. Must be off now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nAnd the Minister strode rapidly away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe chatted in a desultory fashion with Major Norman. In the centre\\r\\nof the little group of men on the platform I recognized a little\\r\\nferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. He was an old\\r\\nacquaintance of Poirotâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94Detective-Inspector Japp, supposed to be\\r\\none of the smartest of Scotland Yardâ\\x80\\x99s officers. He came over and\\r\\ngreeted my friend cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI heard you were on this job too. Smart bit of work. So far\\r\\ntheyâ\\x80\\x99ve got away with the goods all right. But I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe they\\r\\ncan keep him hidden long. Our people are going through France with\\r\\na toothcomb. So are the French. I canâ\\x80\\x99t help feeling itâ\\x80\\x99s only a\\r\\nmatter of hours now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is, if heâ\\x80\\x99s still alive,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the tall detective\\r\\ngloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\nJappâ\\x80\\x99s face fell. â\\x80\\x9cYes. . . . But somehow Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got the feeling heâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nalive all right.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot nodded. â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes; heâ\\x80\\x99s alive. But can he be found in time?\\r\\nI, like you, did not believe he could be hidden so long.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whistle blew, and we all trooped up into the Pullman car. Then,\\r\\nwith a slow, unwilling jerk, the train drew out of the station.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a curious journey. The Scotland Yard men crowded together.\\r\\nMaps of Northern France were spread out, and eager forefingers\\r\\ntraced the lines of roads and villages. Each man had his own pet\\r\\ntheory. Poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring\\r\\nin front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me\\r\\nof a puzzled child. I talked to Norman, whom I found quite an\\r\\namusing fellow. On arriving at Dover Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour moved me\\r\\nto intense amusement. The little man, as he went on board the boat,\\r\\nclutched desperately at my arm. The wind was blowing lustily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon Dieu!_â\\x80\\x9d he murmured. â\\x80\\x9cThis is terrible!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave courage, Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cYou will succeed. You will find\\r\\nhim. I am sure of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, _mon ami_, you mistake my emotion. It is this villainous sea\\r\\nthat troubles me! The _mal de mer_â\\x80\\x94it is horrible suffering!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d I said, rather taken aback.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first throb of the engines was felt, and Poirot groaned and\\r\\nclosed his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMajor Norman has a map of Northern France if you would like to\\r\\nstudy it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot shook his head impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut no, but no! Leave me, my friend. See you, to think, the\\r\\nstomach and the brain must be in harmony. Laverguier has a method\\r\\nmost excellent for averting the _mal de mer_. You breathe inâ\\x80\\x94and\\r\\noutâ\\x80\\x94slowly, soâ\\x80\\x94turning the head from left to right and counting\\r\\nsix between each breath.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and\\r\\nsmiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguierâ\\x80\\x99s system\\r\\nhad succeeded â\\x80\\x9cto a marvel!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJappâ\\x80\\x99s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNonsense! The car started from Boulogneâ\\x80\\x94here they branched off.\\r\\nNow, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another\\r\\ncar. See?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said the tall detective, â\\x80\\x9cI shall make for the seaports.\\r\\nTen to one, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve smuggled him on board a ship.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJapp shook his head. â\\x80\\x9cToo obvious. The order went out at once to\\r\\nclose all the ports.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day was just breaking as we landed. Major Norman touched Poirot\\r\\non the arm. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a military car here waiting for you, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to\\r\\nleave Boulogne.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a\\r\\nprivate room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shot a quick glance at us. â\\x80\\x9cIt is not so that the good detective\\r\\nshould act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy.\\r\\nHe must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty\\r\\nroad and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. He must\\r\\ngather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea,\\r\\nis it not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes challenged us. â\\x80\\x9cBut Iâ\\x80\\x94Hercule Poirotâ\\x80\\x94tell you that it is\\r\\nnot so! The true clues are withinâ\\x80\\x94_here_!â\\x80\\x9d He tapped his forehead.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient\\r\\nfor me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the\\r\\nlittle grey cells within. Secretly and silently they do their part,\\r\\nuntil suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a\\r\\nspotâ\\x80\\x94soâ\\x80\\x94and I say: the Prime Minister is _there_! And it is so!\\r\\nWith method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic\\r\\nrushing to France was a mistakeâ\\x80\\x94it is playing a childâ\\x80\\x99s game of\\r\\nhide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to\\r\\nwork the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking\\r\\nhis eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming\\r\\nsteadily greener and greener. The Scotland Yard man was obviously\\r\\ncontemptuous, Major Norman was bored and impatient, and I myself\\r\\nfound the time pass with wearisome slowness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I got up, and strolled as noiselessly as I could to the\\r\\nwindow. The matter was becoming a farce. I was secretly concerned\\r\\nfor my friend. If he failed, I would have preferred him to fail in\\r\\na less ridiculous manner. Out of the window I idly watched the\\r\\ndaily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay\\r\\nalongside the quay.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I was aroused by Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s voice close to my elbow.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mes amis_, let us start!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned. An extraordinary transformation had come over my friend.\\r\\nHis eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to\\r\\nthe uttermost.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been an imbecile, my friends! But I see daylight at last.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor Norman moved hastily to the door. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll order the car.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no need. I shall not use it. Thank Heaven the wind has\\r\\nfallen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean you are going to walk, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, my young friend. I am no St. Peter. I prefer to cross the sea\\r\\nby boat.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo cross the _sea_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. To work with method, one must begin from the beginning. And\\r\\nthe beginning of this affair was in England. Therefore, we return\\r\\nto England.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt three oâ\\x80\\x99clock, we stood once more upon Charing Cross platform.\\r\\nTo all our expostulations, Poirot turned a deaf ear, and reiterated\\r\\nagain and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of\\r\\ntime, but the only way. On the way over, he had conferred with\\r\\nNorman in a low voice, and the latter had despatched a sheaf of\\r\\ntelegrams from Dover.\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing to the special passes held by Norman, we got through\\r\\neverywhere in record time. In London, a large police car was\\r\\nwaiting for us, with some plain-clothes men, one of whom handed a\\r\\ntypewritten sheet of paper to my friend. He answered my inquiring\\r\\nglance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of\\r\\nLondon. I wired for it from Dover.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were whirled rapidly through the London streets. We were on the\\r\\nBath Road. On we went, through Hammersmith, Chiswick and Brentford.\\r\\nI began to see our objective. Through Windsor and on to Ascot. My\\r\\nheart gave a leap. Ascot was where Daniels had an aunt living. We\\r\\nwere after _him_, then, not Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa. Poirot jumped out and\\r\\nrang the bell. I saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his\\r\\nface. Plainly, he was not satisfied. The bell was answered. He was\\r\\nushered inside. In a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into\\r\\nthe car with a short, sharp shake of his head. My hopes began to\\r\\ndie down. It was past four now. Even if he found certain evidence\\r\\nincriminating Daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he\\r\\ncould wring from some one the exact spot in France where they were\\r\\nholding the Prime Minister?\\r\\n\\r\\nOur return progress towards London was an interrupted one. We\\r\\ndeviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally\\r\\nstopped at a small building, which I had no difficulty in\\r\\nrecognizing as a cottage hospital. Poirot only spent a few minutes\\r\\nat each, but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more\\r\\nrestored.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe whispered something to Norman, to which the latter replied:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, if you turn off to the left, you will find them waiting by\\r\\nthe bridge.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe turned up a side road, and in the failing light I discerned a\\r\\nsecond car, waiting by the side of the road. It contained two men\\r\\nin plain clothes. Poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we\\r\\nstarted off in a northerly direction, the other car following close\\r\\nbehind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the\\r\\nnorthern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door\\r\\nof a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own\\r\\ngrounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the\\r\\ndetectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened\\r\\nit. The detective spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am a police officer, and I have a warrant to search this house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of\\r\\nmiddle-age appeared behind her in the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShut the door, Edith. They are burglars, I expect.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same\\r\\nmoment blew a whistle. Instantly the other detectives ran up, and\\r\\npoured into the house, shutting the door behind them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorman and I spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity.\\r\\nFinally the door reopened, and the men emerged, escorting three\\r\\nprisonersâ\\x80\\x94a woman and two men. The woman, and one of the men, were\\r\\ntaken to the second car. The other man was placed in our car by\\r\\nPoirot himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must go with the others, my friend. But have great care of this\\r\\ngentleman. You do not know him, no? _Eh bien_, let me present to\\r\\nyou, Monsieur Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOâ\\x80\\x99Murphy! I _gaped_ at him open-mouthed as we started again. He\\r\\nwas not handcuffed, but I did not fancy he would try to escape. He\\r\\nsat there staring in front of him as though dazed. Anyway, Norman\\r\\nand I would be more than a match for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my surprise, we still kept a northerly route. We were not\\r\\nreturning to London, then! I was much puzzled. Suddenly, as the\\r\\ncar slowed down, I recognized that we were close to Hendon\\r\\nAerodrome. Immediately I grasped Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s idea. He proposed to\\r\\nreach France by aeroplane.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sporting idea, but, on the face of it, impracticable. A\\r\\ntelegram would be far quicker. Time was everything. He must leave\\r\\nthe personal glory of rescuing the Prime Minister to others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we drew up, Major Norman jumped out, and a plain-clothes man\\r\\ntook his place. He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and\\r\\nthen went off briskly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, too, jumped out, and caught Poirot by the arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place?\\r\\nBut, look here, you must wire to France at once. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be too late\\r\\nif you go yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUnfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be\\r\\nsent by telegram.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Major Norman returned, accompanied by a young\\r\\nofficer in the uniform of the Flying Corps.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is Captain Lyall, who will fly you over to France. He can\\r\\nstart at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWrap up warmly, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said the young pilot. â\\x80\\x9cI can lend you a\\r\\ncoat, if you like.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot was consulting his enormous watch. He murmured to himself:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, there is timeâ\\x80\\x94just time.â\\x80\\x9d Then he looked up, and bowed\\r\\npolitely to the young officer. â\\x80\\x9cI thank you, monsieur. But it is\\r\\nnot I who am your passenger. It is this gentleman here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved a little aside as he spoke, and a figure came forward out\\r\\nof the darkness. It was the second male prisoner who had gone in\\r\\nthe other car, and as the light fell on his face, I gave a gasp of\\r\\nsurprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n_It was the Prime Minister!_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake, tell me all about it,â\\x80\\x9d I cried impatiently, as\\r\\nPoirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. â\\x80\\x9cHow in the world\\r\\ndid they manage to smuggle him back to England?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was no need to smuggle him back,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot dryly. â\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nPrime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way\\r\\nfrom Windsor to London.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his\\r\\nsecretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on\\r\\nhis faceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut by whom?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime\\r\\nMinister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and\\r\\ndirects Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite\\r\\nunsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a\\r\\nlarge car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals\\r\\nto Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy to stop. Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches.\\r\\nDaniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an\\r\\ninstantaneous anÃ¦sthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform\\r\\ntrick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are\\r\\ndragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of\\r\\nsubstitutes take their places.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Pas du tout!_ Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating\\r\\ncelebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to\\r\\npersonate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far\\r\\neasier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for\\r\\nOâ\\x80\\x99Murphyâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98double,â\\x80\\x99 no one was going to take much notice of him\\r\\nuntil after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he\\r\\nwould have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing\\r\\nCross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy,\\r\\nhe emerges as some one quite different. Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy has disappeared,\\r\\nleaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the man who personated the Prime Minister was seen by every\\r\\none!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately.\\r\\nAnd Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as\\r\\npossible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual\\r\\nin his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering\\r\\nfrom shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. Mr. MacAdam\\r\\nhas a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible\\r\\nbefore any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep\\r\\nup as far as France. There it would be impracticable and\\r\\nimpossibleâ\\x80\\x94so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this\\r\\ncountry hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into\\r\\nthe details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the\\r\\nabduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and\\r\\nchloroformed in a convincing manner.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be\\r\\narrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of\\r\\nsuspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually\\r\\nbe released for lack of evidence.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the real Prime Minister?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe and Oâ\\x80\\x99Murphy were driven straight to the house of â\\x80\\x98Mrs.\\r\\nEverard,â\\x80\\x99 at Hampstead, Danielsâ\\x80\\x99 so-called â\\x80\\x98aunt.â\\x80\\x99 In reality, she\\r\\nis Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her\\r\\nfor some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to\\r\\nthemâ\\x80\\x94to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he\\r\\ndid not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I began to work the right wayâ\\x80\\x94from _within_! I could not make\\r\\nthat shooting affair fit inâ\\x80\\x94but when I saw that the net result of\\r\\nit was that _the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound\\r\\nup_ I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage\\r\\nhospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one\\r\\nanswering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed\\r\\nthat morning, I was sure! After that, it was childâ\\x80\\x99s-play for a\\r\\nmind like mine!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just\\r\\nreceived. It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in the day the evening papers published an account of the\\r\\nAllied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent\\r\\novation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had\\r\\nproduced a deep and lasting impression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  IX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of\\r\\nScotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting\\r\\nhis arrival. Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the\\r\\ncups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing,\\r\\nrather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on\\r\\nthe metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The\\r\\nkettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it\\r\\ncontained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npalate than what he described as â\\x80\\x9cyour English poison.â\\x80\\x9d A sharp\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9crat-tatâ\\x80\\x9d sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered\\r\\nbriskly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHope Iâ\\x80\\x99m not late,â\\x80\\x9d he said as he greeted us. â\\x80\\x9cTo tell the truth,\\r\\nI was yarning with Miller, the man whoâ\\x80\\x99s in charge of the Davenheim\\r\\ncase.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been\\r\\nfull of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner\\r\\nof Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On\\r\\nSaturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been\\r\\nseen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details\\r\\nfrom Japp.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should have thought,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked, â\\x80\\x9cthat it would be almost\\r\\nimpossible for anyone to â\\x80\\x98disappearâ\\x80\\x99 nowadays.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch,\\r\\nand said sharply:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe exact, my friend. What do you mean by â\\x80\\x98disappearâ\\x80\\x99? To which\\r\\nclass of disappearance are you referring?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre disappearances classified and labelled, then?â\\x80\\x9d I laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapp smiled also. Poirot frowned at us both.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut certainly they are! They fall into three categories: First,\\r\\nand most common, the voluntary disappearance. Second, the much\\r\\nabused â\\x80\\x98loss of memoryâ\\x80\\x99 caseâ\\x80\\x94rare, but occasionally genuine. Third,\\r\\nmurder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. Do you\\r\\nrefer to all three as impossible of execution?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery nearly so, I should think. You might lose your own memory,\\r\\nbut some one would be sure to recognize youâ\\x80\\x94especially in the case\\r\\nof a well-known man like Davenheim. Then â\\x80\\x98bodiesâ\\x80\\x99 canâ\\x80\\x99t be made to\\r\\nvanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in\\r\\nlonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the\\r\\nabsconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run\\r\\ndown in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off\\r\\nfrom foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched;\\r\\nand, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance\\r\\nwill be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. Heâ\\x80\\x99s up\\r\\nagainst civilization.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon ami_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cyou make one error. You do not allow\\r\\nfor the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x94or with himself in a figurative senseâ\\x80\\x94might be that rare\\r\\nmachine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a\\r\\ncareful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see\\r\\nwhy he should not be successful in baffling the police force.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut not _you_, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d said Japp good-humouredly, winking at\\r\\nme. â\\x80\\x9cHe couldnâ\\x80\\x99t baffle _you_, eh, Monsieur Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMe, also! Why not? It is true that I approach such problems with\\r\\nan exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only\\r\\ntoo rare in the new generation of detectives!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJapp grinned more widely.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cMiller, the man whoâ\\x80\\x99s on this case, is\\r\\na smart chap. You may be very sure he wonâ\\x80\\x99t overlook a footprint,\\r\\nor a cigar-ash, or a crumb even. Heâ\\x80\\x99s got eyes that see everything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, _mon ami_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, â\\x80\\x9chas the London sparrow. But all the\\r\\nsame, I should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem\\r\\nof Mr. Davenheim.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome now, monsieur, youâ\\x80\\x99re not going to run down the value of\\r\\ndetails as clues?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy no means. These things are all good in their way. The danger\\r\\nis they may assume undue importance. Most details are insignificant;\\r\\none or two are vital. It is the brain, the little grey cellsâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he\\r\\ntapped his foreheadâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9con which one must rely. The senses mislead.\\r\\nOne must seek the truth withinâ\\x80\\x94not without.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake\\r\\nto solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly what I do meanâ\\x80\\x94granted the facts were placed\\r\\nbefore me. I regard myself as a consulting specialist.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJapp slapped his knee. â\\x80\\x9cHanged if I donâ\\x80\\x99t take you at your word.\\r\\nBet you a fiver that you canâ\\x80\\x99t lay your handâ\\x80\\x94or rather tell me\\r\\nwhere to lay my handâ\\x80\\x94on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week\\r\\nis out.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot considered. â\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien, mon ami_, I accept. _Le sport_, it\\r\\nis the passion of you English. Nowâ\\x80\\x94the facts.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the\\r\\n12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country\\r\\nplace, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the\\r\\ngrounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody\\r\\nagrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. After\\r\\ntea he put his head into his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s boudoir, saying that he was\\r\\ngoing to stroll down to the village and post some letters. He added\\r\\nthat he was expecting a Mr. Lowen, on business. If he should come\\r\\nbefore he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and\\r\\nasked to wait. Mr. Davenheim then left the house by the front door,\\r\\npassed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, andâ\\x80\\x94was never\\r\\nseen again. From that hour, he vanished completely.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrettyâ\\x80\\x94very prettyâ\\x80\\x94altogether a charming little problem,â\\x80\\x9d murmured\\r\\nPoirot. â\\x80\\x9cProceed, my good friend.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick\\r\\nblack moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he\\r\\nhad an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. He gave the name of Lowen,\\r\\nand in accordance with the bankerâ\\x80\\x99s instructions was shown into\\r\\nthe study. Nearly an hour passed. Mr. Davenheim did not return.\\r\\nFinally Mr. Lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable\\r\\nto wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. Mrs.\\r\\nDavenheim apologized for her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s absence, which seemed\\r\\nunaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor.\\r\\nMr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on\\r\\nSunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make\\r\\nneither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally\\r\\nto have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office;\\r\\nnor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station\\r\\nthey were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor\\r\\nhad not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some\\r\\nlonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of\\r\\nthe large reward offered for information, the driver of it would\\r\\nhave come forward to tell what he knew. True, there was a small\\r\\nrace-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to\\r\\nthat station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since\\r\\nthen his photograph and a full description of him have been\\r\\ncirculated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give\\r\\nany news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from\\r\\nall over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn Monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light.\\r\\nBehind a portiÃ¨re in Mr. Davenheimâ\\x80\\x99s study stands a safe, and that\\r\\nsafe had been broken into and rifled. The windows were fastened\\r\\nsecurely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary\\r\\nout of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house\\r\\nfastened them again afterwards. On the other hand, Sunday having\\r\\nintervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is\\r\\nlikely that the burglary was committed on the Saturday, and remained\\r\\nundetected until Monday.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_PrÃ©cisÃ©ment_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot dryly. â\\x80\\x9cWell, is he arrested, _ce\\r\\npauvre M. Lowen_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJapp grinned. â\\x80\\x9cNot yet. But heâ\\x80\\x99s under pretty close supervision.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot nodded. â\\x80\\x9cWhat was taken from the safe? Have you any idea?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm\\r\\nand Mrs. Davenheim. Apparently there was a considerable amount in\\r\\nbearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large\\r\\ntransaction having been just carried through. There was also a\\r\\nsmall fortune in jewellery. All Mrs. Davenheimâ\\x80\\x99s jewels were kept\\r\\nin the safe. The purchasing of them had become a passion with her\\r\\nhusband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not\\r\\nmake her a present of some rare and costly gem.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAltogether a good haul,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully. â\\x80\\x9cNow, what\\r\\nabout Lowen? Is it known what his business was with Davenheim that\\r\\nevening?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. Lowen\\r\\nis a speculator in quite a small way. Nevertheless, he has been\\r\\nable once or twice to score a _coup_ off Davenheim in the market,\\r\\nthough it seems they seldom or never actually met. It was a matter\\r\\nconcerning some South American shares which led the banker to make\\r\\nhis appointment.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad Davenheim interests in South America, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe so. Mrs. Davenheim happened to mention that he spent\\r\\nall last autumn in Buenos Ayres.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAny trouble in his home life? Were the husband and wife on good\\r\\nterms?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful.\\r\\nMrs. Davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. Quite a\\r\\nnonentity, I think.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen we must not look for the solution of the mystery there. Had\\r\\nhe any enemies?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many\\r\\npeople whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular\\r\\ngood-will. But there was no one likely to make away with himâ\\x80\\x94and,\\r\\nif they had, where is the body?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly. As Hastings says, bodies have a habit of coming to light\\r\\nwith fatal persistency.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round\\r\\nto the side of the house toward the rose-garden. The long French\\r\\nwindow of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim\\r\\nfrequently entered and left the house that way. But the man was a\\r\\ngood way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say\\r\\nwhether it was the figure of his master or not. Also, he cannot\\r\\nfix the time with any accuracy. It must have been before six, as\\r\\nthe gardeners cease work at that time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Mr. Davenheim left the house?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout half-past five or thereabouts.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat lies beyond the rose-garden?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA lake.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith a boathouse?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, a couple of punts are kept there. I suppose youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking\\r\\nof suicide, Monsieur Poirot? Well, I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind telling you that\\r\\nMillerâ\\x80\\x99s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water\\r\\ndragged. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the kind of man he is!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. â\\x80\\x9cHastings, I pray you,\\r\\nhand me that copy of the _Daily Megaphone_. If I remember rightly,\\r\\nthere is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI rose, and found the sheet required. Poirot studied the features\\r\\nattentively.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m!â\\x80\\x9d he murmured. â\\x80\\x9cWears his hair rather long and wavy, full\\r\\nmoustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. Eyes dark?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHair and beard turning grey?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detective nodded. â\\x80\\x9cWell, Monsieur Poirot, what have you got to\\r\\nsay to it all? Clear as daylight, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, most obscure.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scotland Yard man looked pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich gives me great hopes of solving it,â\\x80\\x9d finished Poirot\\r\\nplacidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI find it a good sign when a case is obscure. If a thing is clear\\r\\nas daylightâ\\x80\\x94_eh bien_, mistrust it! Some one has made it so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJapp shook his head almost pityingly. â\\x80\\x9cWell, each to their fancy.\\r\\nBut itâ\\x80\\x99s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not see,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cI shut my eyesâ\\x80\\x94and think.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJapp sighed. â\\x80\\x9cWell, youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a clear week to think in.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you will bring me any fresh developments that ariseâ\\x80\\x94the result\\r\\nof the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller,\\r\\nfor instance?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s in the bargain.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeems a shame, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d said Japp to me as I accompanied him\\r\\nto the door. â\\x80\\x9cLike robbing a child!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I\\r\\nre-entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien!_â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot immediately. â\\x80\\x9cYou make fun of Papa Poirot,\\r\\nis it not so?â\\x80\\x9d He shook his finger at me. â\\x80\\x9cYou do not trust his\\r\\ngrey cells? Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little\\r\\nproblemâ\\x80\\x94incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two\\r\\npoints of interest.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe lake!â\\x80\\x9d I said significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd even more than the lake, the boathouse!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked sidewise at Poirot. He was smiling in his most inscrutable\\r\\nfashion. I felt that, for the moment, it would be quite useless to\\r\\nquestion him further.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe heard nothing of Japp until the following evening, when he\\r\\nwalked in about nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock. I saw at once by his expression that\\r\\nhe was bursting with news of some kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien_, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cAll goes well? But do\\r\\nnot tell me that you have discovered the body of Mr. Davenheim in\\r\\nyour lake, because I shall not believe you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe havenâ\\x80\\x99t found the body, but we did find his _clothes_â\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nidentical clothes he was wearing that day. What do you say to\\r\\nthat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAny other clothes missing from the house?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, his valet is quite positive on that point. The rest of his\\r\\nwardrobe is intact. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s more. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve arrested Lowen. One of the\\r\\nmaids, whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows, declares\\r\\nthat she saw Lowen coming _towards_ the study through the\\r\\nrose-garden about a quarter past six. That would be about ten\\r\\nminutes before he left the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat does he himself say to that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDenied first of all that he had ever left the study. But the maid\\r\\nwas positive, and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten\\r\\njust stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of\\r\\nrose. Rather a weak story! And thereâ\\x80\\x99s fresh evidence against him\\r\\ncome to light. Mr. Davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with\\r\\na solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand. Well,\\r\\nthat ring was pawned in London on Saturday night by a man called\\r\\nBilly Kellett! Heâ\\x80\\x99s already known to the policeâ\\x80\\x94did three months\\r\\nlast autumn for lifting an old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s watch. It seems he tried\\r\\nto pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded\\r\\nat the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted\\r\\na policeman, and was run in in consequence. I went to Bow Street\\r\\nwith Miller and saw him. Heâ\\x80\\x99s sober enough now, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind\\r\\nadmitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting\\r\\nhe might be charged with murder. This is his yarn, and a very queer\\r\\none it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was at Entfield races on Saturday, though I dare say scarfpins\\r\\nwas his line of business, rather than betting. Anyway, he had a\\r\\nbad day, and was down on his luck. He was tramping along the road\\r\\nto Chingside, and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got\\r\\ninto the village. A few minutes later he noticed a man coming along\\r\\nthe road to the village, â\\x80\\x98dark-complexioned gent, with a big\\r\\nmoustache, one of them city toffs,â\\x80\\x99 is his description of the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones. Just\\r\\nbefore he got abreast of him, the man looked quickly up and down\\r\\nthe road, and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object\\r\\nfrom his pocket and threw it over the hedge. Then he went on\\r\\ntowards the station. Now, the object he had thrown over the hedge\\r\\nhad fallen with a slight â\\x80\\x98chinkâ\\x80\\x99 which aroused the curiosity of\\r\\nthe human derelict in the ditch. He investigated and, after a short\\r\\nsearch, discovered the ring! That is Kellettâ\\x80\\x99s story. Itâ\\x80\\x99s only\\r\\nfair to say that Lowen denies it utterly, and of course the word\\r\\nof a man like Kellett canâ\\x80\\x99t be relied upon in the slightest. Itâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwithin the bounds of possibility that he met Davenheim in the lane\\r\\nand robbed and murdered him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery improbable, _mon ami_. He had no means of disposing of the\\r\\nbody. It would have been found by now. Secondly, the open way in\\r\\nwhich he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to\\r\\nget it. Thirdly, your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer. Fourthly,\\r\\nas he has been in prison since Saturday, it would be too much of\\r\\na coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of\\r\\nLowen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJapp nodded. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t say youâ\\x80\\x99re not right. But all the same, you\\r\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t get a jury to take much note of a jailbirdâ\\x80\\x99s evidence. What\\r\\nseems odd to me is that Lowen couldnâ\\x80\\x99t find a cleverer way of\\r\\ndisposing of the ring.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders. â\\x80\\x9cWell, after all, if it were found\\r\\nin the neighbourhood, it might be argued that Davenheim himself\\r\\nhad dropped it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why remove it from the body at all?â\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere might be a reason for that,â\\x80\\x9d said Japp. â\\x80\\x9cDo you know that\\r\\njust beyond the lake, a little gate leads out on to the hill, and\\r\\nnot three minutesâ\\x80\\x99 walk brings you toâ\\x80\\x94what do you think?â\\x80\\x94a _lime\\r\\nkiln_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cYou mean that the lime which destroyed\\r\\nthe body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cthat that explains everything. What a\\r\\nhorrible crime!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy common consent we both turned and looked at Poirot. He seemed\\r\\nlost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme\\r\\nmental effort. I felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting\\r\\nitself. What would his first words be? We were not long left in\\r\\ndoubt. With a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and\\r\\nturning to Japp, he asked:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you any idea, my friend, whether Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim\\r\\noccupied the same bedroom?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment\\r\\nwe both stared in silence. Then Japp burst into a laugh. â\\x80\\x9cGood\\r\\nLord, Monsieur Poirot, I thought you were coming out with something\\r\\nstartling. As to your question, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou could find out?â\\x80\\x9d asked Poirot with curious persistence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, certainlyâ\\x80\\x94if you _really_ want to know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Merci, mon ami_. I should be obliged if you would make a point\\r\\nof it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJapp stared at him a few minutes longer, but Poirot seemed to have\\r\\nforgotten us both. The detective shook his head sadly at me, and\\r\\nmurmuring, â\\x80\\x9cPoor old fellow! Warâ\\x80\\x99s been too much for him!â\\x80\\x9d gently\\r\\nwithdrew from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, I took a sheet of paper,\\r\\nand amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. My friendâ\\x80\\x99s voice\\r\\naroused me. He had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk\\r\\nand alert.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Que faites vous lÃ\\xa0, mon ami?_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of\\r\\ninterest in this affair.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou become methodicalâ\\x80\\x94at last!â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI concealed my pleasure. â\\x80\\x9cShall I read them to you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy all means.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI cleared my throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98One: All the evidence points to Lowen having been the man who\\r\\nforced the safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Two: He had a grudge against Davenheim.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Three: He lied in his first statement that he had never left the\\r\\nstudy.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Four: If you accept Billy Kellettâ\\x80\\x99s story as true, Lowen is\\r\\nunmistakably implicated.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI paused. â\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, for I felt that I had put my finger on\\r\\nall the vital facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. â\\x80\\x9c_Mon\\r\\npauvre ami!_ But it is that you have not the gift! The important\\r\\ndetail, you appreciate him never! Also, your reasoning is false.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet me take your four points.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne: Mr. Lowen could not possibly know that he would have the\\r\\nchance to open the safe. He came for a business interview. He could\\r\\nnot know beforehand that Mr. Davenheim would be absent posting a\\r\\nletter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe might have seized his opportunity,â\\x80\\x9d I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the tools? City gentlemen do not carry round housebreakerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ntools on the off chance! And one could not cut into that safe with\\r\\na penknife, _bien entendu_!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what about Number Two?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou say Lowen had a grudge against Mr. Davenheim. What you mean\\r\\nis that he had once or twice got the better of him. And presumably\\r\\nthose transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting\\r\\nhimself. In any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a\\r\\nman you have got the better ofâ\\x80\\x94it is more likely to be the other\\r\\nway about. Whatever grudge there might have been would have been\\r\\non Mr. Davenheimâ\\x80\\x99s side.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you canâ\\x80\\x99t deny that he lied about never having left the\\r\\nstudy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. But he may have been frightened. Remember, the missing manâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nclothes had just been discovered in the lake. Of course, as usual,\\r\\nhe would have done better to speak the truth.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the fourth point?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI grant you that. If Kellettâ\\x80\\x99s story is true, Lowen is undeniably\\r\\nimplicated. That is what makes the affair so very interesting.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I did appreciate _one_ vital fact?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhapsâ\\x80\\x94but you have entirely overlooked the two most important\\r\\npoints, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole\\r\\nmatter.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd pray, what are they?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last\\r\\nfew years for buying jewellery. Two, his trip to Buenos Ayres last\\r\\nautumn.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot, you are joking!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am most serious. Ah, sacred thunder, but I hope Japp will not\\r\\nforget my little commission.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had\\r\\nremembered it so well that a telegram was handed to Poirot about\\r\\neleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock the next day. At his request I opened it and read\\r\\nit out:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAha!â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now we are in mid June! All is solved!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have no moneys in the bank of Davenheim and Salmon, _mon\\r\\nami_?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d I said, wondering. â\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause I should advise you to withdraw itâ\\x80\\x94before it is too\\r\\nlate.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, what do you expect?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI expect a big smash in a few daysâ\\x80\\x94perhaps sooner. Which reminds\\r\\nme, we will return the compliment of a _dÃ©pÃªche_ to Japp. A pencil,\\r\\nI pray you, and a form. _VoilÃ\\xa0!_ â\\x80\\x98Advise you to withdraw any money\\r\\ndeposited with firm in question.â\\x80\\x99 That will intrigue him, the good\\r\\nJapp! His eyes will open wideâ\\x80\\x94wide! He will not comprehend in the\\r\\nslightestâ\\x80\\x94until to-morrow, or the next day!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute\\r\\nto my friendâ\\x80\\x99s remarkable powers. In every paper was a huge headline\\r\\ntelling of the sensational failure of the Davenheim bank. The\\r\\ndisappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different\\r\\naspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of\\r\\nthe bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and\\r\\nJapp rushed in. In his left hand was a paper; in his right was\\r\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of\\r\\nmy friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you know, Monsieur Poirot? How the blazes could you know?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot smiled placidly at him. â\\x80\\x9cAh, _mon ami_, after your wire, it\\r\\nwas a certainty! From the commencement, see you, it struck me that\\r\\nthe safe burglary was somewhat remarkable. Jewels, ready money,\\r\\nbearer bondsâ\\x80\\x94all so conveniently arranged forâ\\x80\\x94whom? Well, the good\\r\\nMonsieur Davenheim was of those who â\\x80\\x98look after Number Oneâ\\x80\\x99 as your\\r\\nsaying goes! It seemed almost certain that it was arranged\\r\\nforâ\\x80\\x94himself! Then his passion of late years for buying jewellery!\\r\\nHow simple! The funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very\\r\\nlikely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put\\r\\naway in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune\\r\\nto be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off\\r\\nthe track. His arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with\\r\\nMr. Lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the\\r\\ngreat man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders\\r\\nthat the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the\\r\\nhouseâ\\x80\\x94where?â\\x80\\x9d Poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for\\r\\nanother boiled egg. He frowned. â\\x80\\x9cIt is really insupportable,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nmurmured, â\\x80\\x9cthat every hen lays an egg of a different size! What\\r\\nsymmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should\\r\\nsort them in dozens at the shop!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind the eggs,â\\x80\\x9d said Japp impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cLet â\\x80\\x99em lay â\\x80\\x99em\\r\\nsquare if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he\\r\\nleft The Cedarsâ\\x80\\x94that is, if you know!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien_, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur\\r\\nDavenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but\\r\\nthey are of the first quality!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know where he is hiding?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly! It is most ingenious.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor the Lordâ\\x80\\x99s sake, tell us, then!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate,\\r\\nplaced them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on\\r\\ntop of them. This little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat\\r\\neffect, and then beamed affectionately on us both.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, my friends, you are men of intelligence. Ask yourselves the\\r\\nquestion which I asked myself. â\\x80\\x98If I were this man, where should\\r\\n_I_ hide?â\\x80\\x99 Hastings, what do you say?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m rather inclined to think Iâ\\x80\\x99d not do a bolt at\\r\\nall. Iâ\\x80\\x99d stay in Londonâ\\x80\\x94in the heart of things, travel by tubes\\r\\nand buses; ten to one Iâ\\x80\\x99d never be recognized. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s safety in\\r\\na crowd.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot turned inquiringly to Japp.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t agree. Get clear away at onceâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the only chance. I\\r\\nwould have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. Iâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nhave a yacht waiting, with steam up, and Iâ\\x80\\x99d be off to one of the\\r\\nmost out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry\\r\\nbegan!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both looked at Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do _you_ say, monsieur?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment he remained silent. Then a very curious smile flitted\\r\\nacross his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy friends, if _I_ were hiding from the police, do you know\\r\\n_where_ I should hide? _In a prison!_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_What?_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are seeking Monsieur Davenheim in order to put him in prison,\\r\\nso you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already\\r\\nthere!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou tell me Madame Davenheim is not a very intelligent woman.\\r\\nNevertheless I think that if you took her to Bow Street and\\r\\nconfronted her with the man Billy Kellett, she would recognize him!\\r\\nIn spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache\\r\\nand those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close. A woman\\r\\nnearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may\\r\\nbe deceived!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBilly Kellett? But heâ\\x80\\x99s known to the police!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid I not tell you Davenheim was a clever man? He prepared his\\r\\nalibi long beforehand. He was not in Buenos Ayres last autumnâ\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nwas creating the character of Billy Kellett, â\\x80\\x98doing three months,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nso that the police should have no suspicions when the time came.\\r\\nHe was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty.\\r\\nIt was worth while doing the thing thoroughly. Onlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien_, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had\\r\\nto _make up as himself_ again, and to sleep with a false beard is\\r\\nnot easyâ\\x80\\x94it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share\\r\\nthe chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the\\r\\nlast six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos\\r\\nAyres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was\\r\\nsure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his\\r\\nmaster going round to the side of the house was quite right. He\\r\\nwent to the boathouse, donned his â\\x80\\x98trampâ\\x80\\x99 clothes, which you may\\r\\nbe sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet, dropped\\r\\nthe others in the lake, and proceeded to carry out his plan by\\r\\npawning the ring in an obvious manner, and then assaulting a\\r\\npoliceman, getting himself safely into the haven of Bow Street,\\r\\nwhere nobody would ever dream of looking for him!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s impossible,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Japp.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAsk Madame,â\\x80\\x9d said my friend, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day a registered letter lay beside Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s plate. He\\r\\nopened it, and a five-pound note fluttered out. My friendâ\\x80\\x99s brow\\r\\npuckered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Ah, sacrÃ©!_ But what shall I do with it? I have much remorse!\\r\\n_Ce pauvre Japp_! Ah, an idea! We will have a little dinner, we\\r\\nthree! That consoles me. It was really too easy. I am ashamed. I,\\r\\nwho would not rob a childâ\\x80\\x94_mille tonnerres! Mon ami_, what have\\r\\nyou, that you laugh so heartily?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  X\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot and I had many friends and acquaintances of an informal\\r\\nnature. Amongst these was to be numbered Dr. Hawker, a near\\r\\nneighbour of ours, and a member of the medical profession. It was\\r\\nthe genial doctorâ\\x80\\x99s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and\\r\\nhave a chat with Poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer.\\r\\nThe doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree,\\r\\nadmired the talents so far removed from his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one particular evening in early June, he arrived about half-past\\r\\neight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery\\r\\ntopic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes. It must\\r\\nhave been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our\\r\\nsitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated\\r\\nherself into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, doctor, youâ\\x80\\x99re wanted! Such a terrible voice. It gave me a\\r\\nturn, it did indeed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognized in our new visitor Dr. Hawkerâ\\x80\\x99s housekeeper, Miss\\r\\nRider. The doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house\\r\\na few streets away. The usually placid Miss Rider was now in a\\r\\nstate bordering on incoherence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat terrible voice? Who is it, and whatâ\\x80\\x99s the trouble?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was the telephone, doctor. I answered itâ\\x80\\x94and a voice spoke.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Help,â\\x80\\x99 it said. â\\x80\\x98Doctorâ\\x80\\x94help. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve killed me!â\\x80\\x99 Then it sort of\\r\\ntailed away. â\\x80\\x98Whoâ\\x80\\x99s speaking?â\\x80\\x99 I said. â\\x80\\x98Whoâ\\x80\\x99s speaking?â\\x80\\x99 Then I\\r\\ngot a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, â\\x80\\x98Foscatineâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94something like\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Regentâ\\x80\\x99s Court.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor uttered an exclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCount Foscatini. He has a flat in Regentâ\\x80\\x99s Court. I must go at\\r\\nonce. What can have happened?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA patient of yours?â\\x80\\x9d asked Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. An Italian,\\r\\nbut he speaks English perfectly. Well, I must wish you good night,\\r\\nMonsieur Poirot, unlessâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI perceive the thought in your mind,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nshall be delighted to accompany you. Hastings, run down and get\\r\\nhold of a taxi.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTaxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly\\r\\npressed for time, but I captured one at last, and we were soon\\r\\nbowling along in the direction of Regentâ\\x80\\x99s Park. Regentâ\\x80\\x99s Court\\r\\nwas a new block of flats, situated just off St. Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Wood Road.\\r\\nThey had only recently been built, and contained the latest service\\r\\ndevices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no one in the hall. The doctor pressed the lift-bell\\r\\nimpatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed\\r\\nattendant sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFlat II. Count Foscatini. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s been an accident there, I\\r\\nunderstand.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stared at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFirst Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard of it. Mr. Gravesâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s Count Foscatiniâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x94went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs the Count alone in the flat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, heâ\\x80\\x99s got two gentlemen dining with him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are they like?â\\x80\\x9d I asked eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were in the lift now, ascending rapidly to the second floor, on\\r\\nwhich Flat II was situated.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t see them myself, sir, but I understand that they were\\r\\nforeign gentlemen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing.\\r\\nNo. II was opposite to us. The doctor rang the bell. There was no\\r\\nreply, and we could hear no sound from within. The doctor rang\\r\\nagain and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no\\r\\nsign of life rewarded us.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is getting serious,â\\x80\\x9d muttered the doctor. He turned to the\\r\\nlift attendant.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs there any pass-key to this door?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is one in the porterâ\\x80\\x99s office downstairs.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet it, then, and, look here, I think youâ\\x80\\x99d better send for the\\r\\npolice.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot approved with a nod of the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man returned shortly; with him came the manager.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you tell me, gentlemen, what is the meaning of all this?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. I received a telephone message from Count Foscatini\\r\\nstating that he had been attacked and was dying. You can understand\\r\\nthat we must lose no timeâ\\x80\\x94if we are not already too late.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager produced the key without more ado, and we all entered\\r\\nthe flat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed first into a small square lounge hall. A door on the\\r\\nright of it was half open. The manager indicated it with a nod.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe dining-room.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Hawker led the way. We followed close on his heels. As we\\r\\nentered the room I gave a gasp. The round table in the centre bore\\r\\nthe remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though\\r\\ntheir occupants had just risen. In the corner, to the right of the\\r\\nfire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a manâ\\x80\\x94or\\r\\nwhat had been a man. His right hand still grasped the base of the\\r\\ntelephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific\\r\\nblow on the head from behind. The weapon was not far to seek. A\\r\\nmarble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the\\r\\nbase of it stained with blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctorâ\\x80\\x99s examination did not take a minute. â\\x80\\x9cStone dead. Must\\r\\nhave been almost instantaneous. I wonder he even managed to\\r\\ntelephone. It will be better not to move him until the police\\r\\narrive.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the managerâ\\x80\\x99s suggestion we searched the flat, but the result\\r\\nwas a foregone conclusion. It was not likely that the murderers\\r\\nwould be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe came back to the dining-room. Poirot had not accompanied us in\\r\\nour tour. I found him studying the centre table with close\\r\\nattention. I joined him. It was a well-polished round mahogany\\r\\ntable. A bowl of roses decorated the centre, and white lace mats\\r\\nreposed on the gleaming surface. There was a dish of fruit, but\\r\\nthe three dessert plates were untouched. There were three\\r\\ncoffee-cups with remains of coffee in themâ\\x80\\x94two black, one with\\r\\nmilk. All three men had taken port, and the decanter, half-full,\\r\\nstood before the centre plate. One of the men had smoked a cigar,\\r\\nthe other two cigarettes. A tortoiseshell-and-silver box, holding\\r\\ncigars and cigarettes, stood open upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enumerated all these facts to myself, but I was forced to admit\\r\\nthat they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation. I\\r\\nwondered what Poirot saw in them to make him so intent. I asked\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon ami_,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9cyou miss the point. I am looking for\\r\\nsomething that I do _not_ see.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA mistakeâ\\x80\\x94even a little mistakeâ\\x80\\x94on the part of the murderer.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen, looked in, and\\r\\nshook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonsieur,â\\x80\\x9d he said to the manager, â\\x80\\x9cexplain to me, I pray, your\\r\\nsystem of serving meals here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is the service lift,â\\x80\\x9d he explained. â\\x80\\x9cIt runs to the kitchens\\r\\nat the top of the building. You order through this telephone, and\\r\\nthe dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. The\\r\\ndirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. No domestic\\r\\nworries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying\\r\\npublicity of always dining in a restaurant.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in\\r\\nthe kitchen. You permit that I mount there?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, certainly, if you like! Roberts, the lift man, will take you\\r\\nup and introduce you; but Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid you wonâ\\x80\\x99t find anything thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nof any use. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and\\r\\ntheyâ\\x80\\x99ll be all lumped together.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens\\r\\nand questioned the man who had taken the order from Flat II.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe order was given from the _Ã\\xa0 la carte menu_â\\x80\\x94for three,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nexplained. â\\x80\\x9cSoup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of\\r\\nbeef, and a rice soufflÃ©. What time? Just about eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock, I\\r\\nshould say. No, Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid the plates and dishes have been all\\r\\nwashed up by now. Unfortunate. You were thinking of finger-prints,\\r\\nI suppose?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot exactly,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, with an enigmatical smile. â\\x80\\x9cI am more\\r\\ninterested in Count Foscatiniâ\\x80\\x99s appetite. Did he partake of every\\r\\ndish?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; but of course I canâ\\x80\\x99t say how much of each he ate. The plates\\r\\nwere all soiled, and the dishes emptyâ\\x80\\x94that is to say, with the\\r\\nexception of the rice soufflÃ©. There was a fair amount of that\\r\\nleft.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, and seemed satisfied with the fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have decidedly to do with a man of method.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean the murderer, or Count Foscatini?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman. After imploring\\r\\nhelp and announcing his approaching demise, he carefully hung up\\r\\nthe telephone receiver.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at Poirot. His words now and his recent inquiries gave me\\r\\nthe glimmering of an idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou suspect poison?â\\x80\\x9d I breathed. â\\x80\\x9cThe blow on the head was a\\r\\nblind.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot merely smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe re-entered the flat to find the local inspector of police had\\r\\narrived with two constables. He was inclined to resent our\\r\\nappearance, but Poirot calmed him with the mention of our Scotland\\r\\nYard friend, Inspector Japp, and we were accorded a grudging\\r\\npermission to remain. It was a lucky thing we were, for we had not\\r\\nbeen back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came\\r\\nrushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was Graves, valet-butler to the late Count Foscatini. The\\r\\nstory he had to tell was a sensational one.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his\\r\\nmaster. They were Italians, and the elder of the two, a man of\\r\\nabout forty, gave his name as Signor Ascanio. The younger was a\\r\\nwell-dressed lad of about twenty-four.\\r\\n\\r\\nCount Foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and\\r\\nimmediately sent Graves out upon some trivial errand. Here the man\\r\\npaused and hesitated in his story. In the end, however, he admitted\\r\\nthat, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed\\r\\nimmediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something\\r\\nof what was going on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not\\r\\nas successful as he had hoped; but he gathered enough to make it\\r\\nclear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed,\\r\\nand that the basis of it was a threat. The discussion was anything\\r\\nbut amicable. In the end, Count Foscatini raised his voice slightly,\\r\\nand the listener heard these words clearly:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have no time to argue further now, gentlemen. If you will dine\\r\\nwith me to-morrow night at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock, we will resume the\\r\\ndiscussion.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfraid of being discovered listening, Graves had then hurried out\\r\\nto do his masterâ\\x80\\x99s errand. This evening the two men had arrived\\r\\npunctually at eight. During dinner they had talked of indifferent\\r\\nmattersâ\\x80\\x94politics, the weather, and the theatrical world. When\\r\\nGraves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee\\r\\nhis master told him that he might have the evening off.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests?â\\x80\\x9d asked the\\r\\ninspector.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir; it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what made me think it must be some\\r\\nbusiness of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with\\r\\nthese gentlemen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat finished Gravesâ\\x80\\x99s story. He had gone out about 8.30, and,\\r\\nmeeting a friend, had accompanied him to the Metropolitan Music\\r\\nHall in Edgware Road.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody had seen the two men leave, but the time of the murder was\\r\\nfixed clearly enough at 8.47. A small clock on the writing-table\\r\\nhad been swept off by Foscatiniâ\\x80\\x99s arm, and had stopped at that\\r\\nhour, which agreed with Miss Riderâ\\x80\\x99s telephone summons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe police surgeon had made his examination of the body, and it\\r\\nwas now lying on the couch. I saw the face for the first timeâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nolive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache,\\r\\nand the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth.\\r\\nNot altogether a pleasant face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said the inspector, refastening his notebook. â\\x80\\x9cThe case\\r\\nseems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands\\r\\non this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s pocket-book by any chance?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly\\r\\nwritten in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, â\\x80\\x9cSignor\\r\\nPaolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us\\r\\nwith a grin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train\\r\\nto the Continong. Well, gentlemen, thatâ\\x80\\x99s about all we can do here.\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s a bad business, but straightforward enough. One of these\\r\\nItalian vendetta things, as likely as not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. Dr. Hawker was\\r\\nfull of excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLike the beginning of a novel, eh? Real exciting stuff. Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbelieve it if you read about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot did not speak. He was very thoughtful. All the evening he\\r\\nhad hardly opened his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat says the master detective, eh?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hawker, clapping him\\r\\non the back. â\\x80\\x9cNothing to work your grey cells over this time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat could there be?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, for example, there is the window.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe window? But it was fastened. Nobody could have got out or in\\r\\nthat way. I noticed it specially.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd why were you able to notice it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor looked puzzled. Poirot hastened to explain.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is to the curtains I refer. They were not drawn. A little odd,\\r\\nthat. And then there was the coffee. It was very black coffee.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery black,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cIn conjunction with that let us\\r\\nremember that very little of the rice soufflÃ© was eaten, and we\\r\\ngetâ\\x80\\x94what?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMoonshine,â\\x80\\x9d laughed the doctor. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re pulling my leg.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever do I pull the leg. Hastings here knows that I am perfectly\\r\\nserious.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you are getting at, all the same,â\\x80\\x9d I confessed.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in\\r\\nwith the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose theyâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ntest his alibi?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWithout doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio\\r\\nthat interests me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think he has an alibi?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is just what worries me. I have no doubt that we shall soon\\r\\nbe enlightened on that point.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Daily Newsmonger_ enabled us to become conversant with\\r\\nsucceeding events.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count\\r\\nFoscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared\\r\\nhe had never been near Regentâ\\x80\\x99s Court either on the evening of the\\r\\ncrime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared\\r\\nentirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel\\r\\nfrom the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace\\r\\nthe second man failed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAscanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than\\r\\nthe Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the\\r\\npolice-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the\\r\\nEmbassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was\\r\\ndischarged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was\\r\\na political one, and was being deliberately hushed up.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. Nevertheless,\\r\\nI was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning\\r\\nthat he was expecting a visitor at eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and that that\\r\\nvisitor was none other than Ascanio himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe wishes to consult you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Du tout_, Hastings. I wish to consult him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat about?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Regentâ\\x80\\x99s Court murder.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are going to prove that he did it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Endeavour to\\r\\nhave the common sense. Ah, that is our friendâ\\x80\\x99s ring.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA few minutes later Signor Ascanio was ushered inâ\\x80\\x94a small, thin\\r\\nman with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes. He remained\\r\\nstanding, darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy little friend tapped himself gently on the chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get\\r\\nto the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid\\r\\nme. Let us commence. Youâ\\x80\\x94in company with a friendâ\\x80\\x94visited the late\\r\\nCount Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9thâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian made an angry gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did nothing of the sort. I have sworn in courtâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_PrÃ©cisÃ©ment_â\\x80\\x94and I have a little idea that you have sworn\\r\\nfalsely.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou threaten me? Bah! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been\\r\\nacquitted.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows\\r\\nI threaten youâ\\x80\\x94but with publicity. Publicity! I see that you do\\r\\nnot like the word. I had an idea that you would not. My little\\r\\nideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. Come, signor, your\\r\\nonly chance is to be frank with me. I do not ask to know whose\\r\\nindiscretions brought you to England. I know this much, you came\\r\\nfor the especial purpose of seeing Count Foscatini.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was not a count,â\\x80\\x9d growled the Italian.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in\\r\\nthe _Almanach de Gotha_. Never mind, the title of count is often\\r\\nuseful in the profession of blackmailing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor\\r\\nAscanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morningâ\\x80\\x94that is\\r\\nso, is it not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was\\r\\nno need. I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man\\r\\nof great position in Italy had come into this scoundrelâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npossession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the\\r\\npapers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon\\r\\nhim by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of\\r\\nthe Embassy was with me. The Count was more reasonable than I had\\r\\nhoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge\\r\\none.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon, how was it paid?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over\\r\\nthe money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers.\\r\\nI never saw him again.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did you not say all this when you were arrested?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn my delicate position I was forced to deny any association with\\r\\nthe man.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how do you account for the events of the evening, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated\\r\\nme. I understand that no money was found in the flat.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot looked at him and shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStrange,â\\x80\\x9d he murmured. â\\x80\\x9cWe all have the little grey cells. And so\\r\\nfew of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I\\r\\nbelieve your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had\\r\\nto make sure.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter bowing his guest out, Poirot returned to his arm-chair and\\r\\nsmiled at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us hear M. le Capitaine Hastings on the case?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I suppose Ascanio is rightâ\\x80\\x94somebody impersonated him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever, never will you use the brains the good God has given you.\\r\\nRecall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that\\r\\nnight. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn. We are\\r\\nin the month of June. It is still light at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock. The light\\r\\nis failing by half-past. _Ã\\x87a vous dit quelque chose?_ I perceive\\r\\na struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us\\r\\ncontinue. The coffee was, as I said, very black. Count Foscatiniâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nteeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason\\r\\nfrom that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there\\r\\nwas coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count\\r\\nFoscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head, utterly bewildered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, I will help you. What evidence have we that Ascanio and his\\r\\nfriend, or two men posing as them, ever came to the flat that\\r\\nnight? Nobody saw them go in; nobody saw them go out. We have the\\r\\nevidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes. Ah, but it\\r\\nwas a clever idea! Graves is a thief and a scoundrel, but what a\\r\\nman of method! He overhears a portion of the conversation in the\\r\\nmorning, enough to realize that Ascanio will be in awkward position\\r\\nto defend himself. The following evening, about eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock, he\\r\\ntells his master he is wanted at the telephone. Foscatini sits\\r\\ndown, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind\\r\\nGraves strikes him down with the marble figure. Then quickly to\\r\\nthe service telephoneâ\\x80\\x94dinner for three! It comes, he lays the\\r\\ntable, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. But he has to\\r\\nget rid of the food too. Not only is he a man of brain; he has a\\r\\nresolute and capacious stomach! But after eating three tournedos,\\r\\nthe rice soufflÃ© is too much for him! He even smokes a cigar and\\r\\ntwo cigarettes to carry out the illusion. Ah, but it was\\r\\nmagnificently thorough! Then, having moved on the hands of the\\r\\nclock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. The one thing he does\\r\\nnot do is to draw the curtains. But if there had been a real dinner\\r\\nparty the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began\\r\\nto fail. Then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift\\r\\nman in passing. He hurries to a telephone box, and as near as\\r\\npossible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his masterâ\\x80\\x99s dying cry.\\r\\nSo successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was\\r\\nput through from Flat II at that time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcept Hercule Poirot, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d I said sarcastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot even Hercule Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d said my friend, with a smile. â\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\nabout to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But\\r\\nyou will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have\\r\\nalready given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable\\r\\nGraves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot _was_ right. He always is, confound him!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  XI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Case of the Missing Will\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a\\r\\npleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received\\r\\na brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an\\r\\nappointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at\\r\\neleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock the following day.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe arrived punctuallyâ\\x80\\x94a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but\\r\\nneatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. Clearly\\r\\na young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great\\r\\nadmirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her\\r\\ngood looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe began, after she had accepted a chair. â\\x80\\x9cI had better begin at\\r\\nthe beginning and tell you the whole story.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you please, mademoiselle.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small\\r\\nyeoman farmer in Devonshire. The farm was a poor one, and the elder\\r\\nbrother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well\\r\\nindeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a\\r\\nvery rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no\\r\\nleanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate\\r\\nhimself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm.\\r\\nHe married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor\\r\\nartist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was\\r\\nfourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living\\r\\nrelation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from\\r\\nAustralia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native\\r\\ncounty. He was exceedingly kind to his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s orphan child, took\\r\\nme to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was\\r\\nhis own daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCrabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old\\r\\nfarmhouse. Farming was in my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s blood, and he was intensely\\r\\ninterested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness\\r\\nitself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as\\r\\nto the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no\\r\\neducation, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed\\r\\nlittle value on what he called â\\x80\\x98book knowledge.â\\x80\\x99 He was especially\\r\\nopposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should\\r\\nlearn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home,\\r\\nand have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed\\r\\nto bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and\\r\\nannoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good\\r\\nbrain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle\\r\\nand I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much\\r\\nattached to each other, we were both self-willed. I was lucky\\r\\nenough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was\\r\\nsuccessful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved\\r\\nto go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my\\r\\nmother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the\\r\\ngifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my\\r\\nuncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other\\r\\nrelations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have\\r\\ntold you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98new-fangled notionsâ\\x80\\x99 of mine, however, I need look for nothing\\r\\nfrom him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply\\r\\nattached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life. We parted\\r\\non that note. â\\x80\\x98You fancy your brains, my girl,â\\x80\\x99 were his last\\r\\nwords. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no book learning, but, for all that, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll pit mine\\r\\nagainst yours any day. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll see what we shall see.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end\\r\\noccasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though\\r\\nhis views remained unaltered. He never referred to my having\\r\\nmatriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health\\r\\nhad been failing, and a month ago he died.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most\\r\\nextraordinary will. By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents\\r\\nare to be at my disposal for a year from his deathâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98during which\\r\\ntime my clever niece may prove her wits,â\\x80\\x99 the actual words run. At\\r\\nthe end of that period, â\\x80\\x98my wits having proved better than hers,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nthe house and all my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s large fortune pass to various\\r\\ncharitable institutions.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were\\r\\nMr. Marshâ\\x80\\x99s only blood relation.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly,\\r\\nand I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes,\\r\\nhe was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas the will drawn up by a lawyer?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the\\r\\nman and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would not even attempt to do such a thing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your\\r\\nuncle?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly how I look upon it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt bears that interpretation, certainly,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSomewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed\\r\\neither a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has\\r\\ngiven you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of\\r\\nassuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at\\r\\nyour disposal. You have made no search yourself?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nundoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you the will or a copy of it with you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through\\r\\nit, nodding to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMade three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given\\r\\nalsoâ\\x80\\x9411 a.m.â\\x80\\x94that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of\\r\\nsearch. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will\\r\\nmade even half-an-hour later would upset this. _Eh bien_,\\r\\nmademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have\\r\\npresented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world\\r\\nin solving it for you. Granted that your uncle was a man of ability,\\r\\nhis grey cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Really, Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s vanity is blatant!)\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute.\\r\\nHastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor to-night. The man\\r\\nand wife who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, their name is Baker.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢   â\\x80¢\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had\\r\\narrived late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received\\r\\na telegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us. They were a pleasant\\r\\ncouple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin,\\r\\nand his wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm.\\r\\n\\r\\nTired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station,\\r\\nwe had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken,\\r\\napple pie, and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent\\r\\nbreakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been\\r\\nthe late Mr. Marshâ\\x80\\x99s study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed\\r\\nwith papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a\\r\\nbig leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its ownerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nconstant resting-place. A big chintz-covered settee ran along the\\r\\nopposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the\\r\\nsame faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien, mon ami_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny\\r\\ncigarettes, â\\x80\\x9cwe must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have\\r\\nmade a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue\\r\\nwill be found in this room. We shall have to go through the\\r\\ndocuments in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not\\r\\nexpect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some\\r\\napparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place.\\r\\nBut first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray\\r\\nof you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot\\r\\nwalked up and down, looking about him approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of\\r\\npapers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory\\r\\nlabelâ\\x80\\x94so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see\\r\\nwith what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the\\r\\nheart. Nothing here offends the eyeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of\\r\\nthe desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. Poirot\\r\\nfrowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled\\r\\nthe words: â\\x80\\x9cKey of Roll Top Desk,â\\x80\\x9d in a crabbed handwriting, quite\\r\\nunlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn alien note,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, frowning. â\\x80\\x9cI could swear that here\\r\\nwe have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has\\r\\nbeen in the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I mistake not, is\\r\\nalso a young lady of method and order.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBaker came in answer to the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBaker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs. Baker,\\r\\nwiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few clear words Poirot set forth the object of his mission.\\r\\nThe Bakers were immediately sympathetic.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUs donâ\\x80\\x99t want to see Miss Violet done out of whatâ\\x80\\x99s hers,â\\x80\\x9d declared\\r\\nthe woman. â\\x80\\x9cCruel hard â\\x80\\x99twould be for hospitals to get it all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker\\r\\nremembered perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been\\r\\nsent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwo?â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil\\r\\noneâ\\x80\\x94and sure enough, so he did do. Us had signed oneâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat time of day was that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBaker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, to be sure, Iâ\\x80\\x99d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven.\\r\\nDonâ\\x80\\x99t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when us got\\r\\nback to kitchen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd afterwards?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve made\\r\\na mistake,â\\x80\\x99 says old master, â\\x80\\x98had to tear the whole thing up. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ntrouble you to sign again,â\\x80\\x99 and us did. And afterwards master give\\r\\nus a tidy sum of money each. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve left you nothing in my will,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsays he, â\\x80\\x98but each year I live youâ\\x80\\x99ll have this to be a nest-egg\\r\\nwhen Iâ\\x80\\x99m goneâ\\x80\\x99; and sure enough, so he did.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot reflected.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfter you had signed the second time, what did Mr. Marsh do? Do\\r\\nyou know?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWent out to the village to pay tradesmenâ\\x80\\x99s books.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat did not seem very promising. Poirot tried another tack. He\\r\\nheld out the key of the desk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that your masterâ\\x80\\x99s writing?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed\\r\\nbefore Baker replied: â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, it is.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s lying,â\\x80\\x9d I thought. â\\x80\\x9cBut why?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas your master let the house?â\\x80\\x94have there been any strangers in\\r\\nit during the last three years?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo visitors?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly Miss Violet.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo strangers of any kind been inside this room?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou forget the workmen, Jim,â\\x80\\x9d his wife reminded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWorkmen?â\\x80\\x9d Poirot wheeled round on her. â\\x80\\x9cWhat workmen?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen\\r\\nhad been in the house to do certain repairs. She was quite vague\\r\\nas to what the repairs were. Her view seemed to be that the whole\\r\\nthing was a fad of her masterâ\\x80\\x99s and quite unnecessary. Part of the\\r\\ntime the workmen had been in the study; but what they had done\\r\\nthere she could not say, as her master had not let either of them\\r\\ninto the room whilst the work was in progress. Unfortunately, they\\r\\ncould not remember the name of the firm employed, beyond the fact\\r\\nthat it was a Plymouth one.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe progress, Hastings,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, rubbing his hands as the\\r\\nBakers left the room. â\\x80\\x9cClearly he made a second will and then had\\r\\nworkmen from Plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place. Instead\\r\\nof wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls, we will\\r\\ngo to Plymouth.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a little trouble, we were able to get the information we\\r\\nwanted. After one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr.\\r\\nMarsh.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy\\r\\nto find the two men who had worked under Mr. Marshâ\\x80\\x99s orders. They\\r\\nremembered the job perfectly. Amongst various other minor jobs,\\r\\nthey had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace,\\r\\nmade a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible\\r\\nto see the join. By pressing on the second brick from the end, the\\r\\nwhole thing was raised. It had been quite a complicated piece of\\r\\nwork, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our\\r\\ninformant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled\\r\\nmoustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the\\r\\nstudy door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into\\r\\neffect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when\\r\\nwe pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once\\r\\ndisclosed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from\\r\\ncomplacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred\\r\\nfragment of stiff paper. But for it, the cavity was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_SacrÃ©!_â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot angrily. â\\x80\\x9cSome one has been before us.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe examined the scrap of paper anxiously. Clearly it was a fragment\\r\\nof what we sought. A portion of Bakerâ\\x80\\x99s signature remained, but no\\r\\nindication of what the terms of the will had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot sat back on his heels. His expression would have been\\r\\ncomical if we had not been so overcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand it not,â\\x80\\x9d he growled. â\\x80\\x9cWho destroyed this? And what\\r\\nwas their object?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Bakers?â\\x80\\x9d I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Pourquoi?_ Neither will makes any provision for them, and they\\r\\nare more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place\\r\\nbecame the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyoneâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nadvantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefitâ\\x80\\x94yes; but one\\r\\ncannot suspect institutions.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nI suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat may be,â\\x80\\x9d he admitted. â\\x80\\x9cOne of your more sensible observations,\\r\\nHastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that\\r\\nmortal man can do. We have successfully pitted our wits against\\r\\nthe late Andrew Marshâ\\x80\\x99s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better\\r\\noff for our success.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a\\r\\ntrain to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad\\r\\nand dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner.\\r\\nSuddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a\\r\\npiercing squeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Vite_, Hastings! Awake and jump! But jump I say!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I knew where I was we were standing on the platform,\\r\\nbareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into\\r\\nthe night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImbecile that I have been!â\\x80\\x9d he cried. â\\x80\\x9cTriple imbecile! Not again\\r\\nwill I vaunt my little grey cells!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a good job at any rate,â\\x80\\x9d I said grumpily. â\\x80\\x9cBut what is this\\r\\nall about?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs usual, when following out his own ideas, Poirot paid absolutely\\r\\nno attention to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe tradesmenâ\\x80\\x99s booksâ\\x80\\x94I have left them entirely out of account!\\r\\nYes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must\\r\\nreturn at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEasier said than done. We managed to get a slow train to Exeter,\\r\\nand there Poirot hired a car. We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in\\r\\nthe small hours of the morning. I pass over the bewilderment of\\r\\nthe Bakers when we had at last aroused them. Paying no attention\\r\\nto anybody, Poirot strode at once to the study.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my\\r\\nfriend,â\\x80\\x9d he deigned to remark. â\\x80\\x9cNow, behold!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the\\r\\nenvelope from it. I stared at him stupidly. How could he possibly\\r\\nhope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? With great care\\r\\nhe cut open the envelope, laying it out flat. Then he lighted the\\r\\nfire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the\\r\\nflame. In a few minutes faint characters began to appear.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook, _mon ami_!â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot in triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked. There were just a few lines of faint writing stating\\r\\nbriefly that he left everything to his niece, Violet Marsh. It was\\r\\ndated March 25, 12.30 p.m., and witnessed by Albert Pike,\\r\\nconfectioner, and Jessie Pike, married woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut is it legal?â\\x80\\x9d I gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs far as I know, there is no law against writing your will in a\\r\\nblend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. The intention of the\\r\\ntestator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation.\\r\\nBut the cleverness of him! He foresaw every step that a searcher\\r\\nwould takeâ\\x80\\x94that I, miserable imbecile, took. He gets two will-forms,\\r\\nmakes the servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will\\r\\nwritten on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen\\r\\ncontaining his little ink mixture. On some excuse he gets the\\r\\nconfectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own\\r\\nsignature, then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to\\r\\nhimself. If his niece sees through his little ruse, she will have\\r\\njustified her choice of life and elaborate education, and be\\r\\nthoroughly welcome to his money.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe didnâ\\x80\\x99t see through it, did she?â\\x80\\x9d I said slowly. â\\x80\\x9cIt seems\\r\\nrather unfair. The old man really won.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut no, Hastings. It is _your_ wits that go astray. Miss Marsh\\r\\nproved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher\\r\\neducation for women by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands.\\r\\nAlways employ the expert. She has amply proved her right to the\\r\\nmoney.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonderâ\\x80\\x94I very much wonderâ\\x80\\x94what old Andrew Marsh would have\\r\\nthought!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  THE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Poirot Investigates, by Agatha Christie\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK POIROT INVESTIGATES ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 61262-0.txt or 61262-0.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/1/2/6/61262/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by an anonymous Project Gutenberg volunteer.\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
